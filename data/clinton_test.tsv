Mitt Romney: A New Course for the Middle East Restore the three sinews of American influence: our economic strength, our military strength and the strength of our values. Disturbing developments are sweeping across the greater Middle East. In Syria, tens of thousands of innocent people have been slaughtered. In Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood has come to power, and the country's peace treaty with Israel hangs In the balance. In Libya, our ambassador was murdered In a terrorist attack. U.S. embassies throughout the region have been stormed in violent protests. And in Iran, the ayatollahs continue to move full tilt toward nuclear-weapons capability, all the while promising to annihilate Israel. These developments are not, as President Obama says, mere \"bumps in the road.\" They are major issues that put our security at risk. Yet amid this upheaval, our country seems to be at the mercy of events rather than shaping them. We're not moving them in a direction that protects our people or our allies. And that's dangerous. If the Middle East descends into chaos, if Iran moves toward nuclear breakout, or if Israel's security is compromised, America could be pulled into the maelstrom. We still have time to address these threats, but it will require a new strategy toward the Middle East The first step is to understand how we got here. Since World War II, America has been the leader of the Free World. We're unique in having earned that role not through conquest but through promoting human rights, free markets and the rule of law. We ally ourselves with like-minded countries, expand prosperity through trade and keep the peace by maintaining a military second to none. But in recent years, President Obama has allowed our leadership to atrophy. Our economy is stuck in a \"recovery\" that barely deserves the name. Our national debt has risen to record levels. Our military, tested by a decade of war, is facing devastating cuts thanks to the budgetary games played by the White House. Finally, our values have been misapplied—and misunderstood—by a president who thinks that weakness will win favor with our adversaries. By failing to maintain the elements of our influence and by stepping away from our allies, President Obama has heightened the prospect of conflict and instability. He does not understand that an American policy that lacks resolve can provoke aggression and encourage disorder. The Middle East is a case in point. The Arab Spring presented an opportunity to help move millions of people from oppression to freedom. But it also presented grave risks. We needed a strategy for success, but the president offered none. And now he seeks to downplay the significance of the calamities of the past few weeks The same incomprehension afflicts the president's policy toward Israel. The president began his term with the explicit policy of creating \"daylight\" between our two countries. He recently downgraded Israel from being our \"closest ally\" in the Middle East to being only \"one of our closest allies.\" It's a diplomatic message that will be received clearly by Israel and its adversaries alike. He dismissed Israel's concerns about Iran as mere \"noise\" that he prefers to \"block out.\" And at a time when Israel needs America to stand with it, he declined to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In this period of uncertainty, we need to apply a coherent strategy of supporting our partners in the Middle East—that is, both governments and individuals who share our values. This means restoring our credibility with Iran. When we say an Iranian nuclear-weapons capability—and the regional instability that comes with it--is unacceptable, the ayatollahs must be made to believe us. It means placing no daylight between the United States and Israel, And it means using the full spectrum of our soft power to encourage liberty and opportunity for those who have for too long known only corruption and oppression. The dignity of work and the ability to steer the course of their lives are the best alternatives to extremism. But this Middle East policy will be undermined unless we restore the three sinews of our influence: our economic strength, our military strength and the strength Of our values. That will require a very different set of policies from those President Obama is pursuing.

Person of Interest: United States UN Ambassador Susan Rice Oct 8, 2012 iloo AM EDT Leslie H. Gelb A diplomat under fire. With the presidential campaign drowning in boredom, commentators were desperately searching for news, preferably a new victim, to brighten their days. And along came Susan Rice. A couple Sundays ago, the U.N. ambassador made the mistake of appearing on the talk shows to insist that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, was \"spontaneous\" rather than a terrorist plot. You would have thought she had said that the pope was a Mormon. Out came the Washington daggers. She lied. She was a shill. Benghazi was no spontaneous event. It was the work of an al Qaeda offshoot. The White House had fumbled key intelligence information and was now trying to cover up its unforgivable mistake. Rice was just covering up for the president. Her reward would be Obama's nominating her to succeed Hillary Clinton as secretary of State. The commentariat immediately rolled out plans to nail Rice and the Obama team to the wall. Peter King, the Grand Inquisitor of the Republicans in the House of Representatives, pledged to \"investigate\" and hold hearings. And that, said the commentariat, would be the end of Rice's hopes to become the new Hillary.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. Now, let's take an unfashionable step back and examine the facts, such as they are. Rice did not make up the \"spontaneous\" story or have it handed to her by White House conspirators. She got it from the same daily intelligence brief given to the president. Those daily intel reports told the very story Rice repeated publicly, i.e., that the Benghazi mob formed more or less on its own, mainly in reaction to the American video cartooning sacred Muslim figures, and that extremists then took advantage to kill, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Rice didn't make up that story. The problem was not with Rice; it was with the inevitably complicated U.S. intelligence process. Her mistake was taking the initial intelligence at face value. The White House biiefers made the same error, and so did I. I too repeated in an op-ed on The Daily Beast what the intelligence briefers told me, but I knew very well that more and contradictory information would appear soon enough. It always does. Sure, the CIA had additional intel from the start, but it hadn't begun to sift through all the communications intercepts, satellite photos, and human reports. It always takes time to sort out facts from fictions and find consistent threads. Seemingly, this gossamer information is now taking shape. Meantime, Rice is still very much in the running for the job at Fogg' Bottom, along with Senator John Kerry, NSC Adviser Tom Donilon, and former diplomat Nicholas Burns, now of Harvard. She was Obama's earliest loyalist in the foreign-policy crowd, and he still likes her, despite lackluster reports on her performance at the U.N. The smears, though flatly inaccurate, won't help her either. What will help her and, more importantly a flagging Obama after the first debate, is hunting down the Benghazi culprits.

"C05739704"	"Here is Susan on this week. She wasn't asked about whether we had any intel. But she did make clear our view that this started spontaneously and then evolved. The only troubling sentence relates to the investigation, specifically: And we'll see when the investigation unfolds whether what was -- what transpired in Benghazi might have unfolded differently in different circumstances.\" But she got pushed there. Waiting on other transcripts. For more on what happened and why, let's bring in the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Dr. Susan Rice. Dr. Rice, thank you for joining us. RICE: Good to be with you, Jake. TAPPER: So, first of all, what is the latest you can tell us on who these attackers were at the embassy or at the consulate in Benghazi? We're hearing that the Libyans have arrested people. They're saying that some people involved were from outside the country, that there might have even been Al Qaida ties. What's the latest information? RICE: Well, Jake, first of all, it's important to know that there's an FBI investigation that has begun and will take some time to be completed. That will tell us with certainty what transpired. But our current best assessment, based on the information that we have at present, is that, in fact, what this began as, it was a spontaneous -- not a premeditated -- response to what had transpired in Cairo. In Cairo, as you know, a few hours earlier, there was a violent protest that was undertaken in reaction to this very offensive video that was disseminated. We believe that folks in Benghazi, a small number of people came to the embassy to -- or to the consulate, rather, to replicate the sort of challenge that was posed in Cairo. And then as that unfolded, it seems to have been hijacked, let us say, by some individual clusters of extremists who came with heavier weapons, weapons that as you know in -- in the wake of the revolution in Libya are -- are quite common and accessible. And it then evolved from there. U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739704 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. We'll wait to see exactly what the investigation finally confirms, but that's the best information we have at present. TAPPER: Why was there such a security breakdown? Why was there not better security at the compound in Benghazi? Why were there not U.S. Marines at the embassy in Tripoli? RICE: Well, first of all, we had a substantial security presence with our personnel... TAPPER: Not substantial enough, though, right? RICE: ... with our personnel and the consulate in Benghazi. Tragically, two of the four Americans who were killed were there providing security. That was their function. And indeed, there were many other colleagues who were doing the same with them. It obviously didn't prove sufficient to the -- the nature of the attack and sufficient in that -- in that moment. And that's why, obviously, we have reinforced our remaining presence in Tripoli and why the president has very -- been very clear that in Libya and throughout the region we are going to call on the governments, first of all, to assume their responsibilities to protect our facilities and our personnel, and we're reinforcing our facilities and our -- our embassies where possible... TAPPER: But why... RICE: ... and where needed. TAPPER: Why would we not have Marines at the embassy in Tripoli to begin with? It would seem like this -- this is obviously an unstable country. This is a region where U.S. interests have been attacked in previous months. Why were there not Marines there to begin with? RICE: First of all, there are Marines in some places around the world. There are not Marines in every facility. That depends on the circumstances. That depends on the requirements. Our presence in Tripoli, as in Benghazi, is relatively new, as you will recall. We've been back post-revolution only for a matter of months. But I've visited there myself, both to Tripoli and Benghazi. I was very grateful to have a strong security presence with me as part of our -- our embassy detachment there. So we certainly are aware that Libya is a place where there have been increasingly some violent incidents. The security personnel that the State Department thought were required were in place. And we'll see when the investigation unfolds whether what was -- what transpired in Benghazi might have unfolded differently in different circumstances. But the president has been very clear. The protection of American personnel and facilities is and will remain our top priority. That's why we've reinforced our presence in Tripoli and elsewhere.

And President Obama pledged to repair America's relationships with the Muslim world. Why does the U.S. seem so impotent? And why is the U.S. even less popular today in some of these Muslim and Arab countries than it was four years ago? RICE: Jake, we're not impotent. We're not even less popular, to challenge that assessment. I don't know on what basis you make that judgment. But let me -- let me point... TAPPER: It just seems that the U.S. government is powerless as this -- as this maelstrom erupts. RICE: It's actually the opposite. First of all, let's be clear about what transpired here. What happened this week in Cairo, in Benghazi, in many other parts of the region... TAPPER: Tunisia, Khartoum... RICE: ... was a result a direct result of a heinous and offensive video that was widely disseminated, that the U.S. government had nothing to do with, which we have made clear is reprehensible and disgusting. We have also been very clear in saying that there is no excuse for violence, there is -- that we have condemned it in the strongest possible terms. But let's look at what's happened. It's quite the opposite of being impotent. We have worked with the governments in Egypt. President Obama picked up the phone and talked to President Morsi in Egypt. And as soon as he did that, the security provided to our personnel in our embassies dramatically increased. President Morsi... TAPPER: It took two days for President Morsi to say anything about this. RICE: President Morsi has been out repeatedly and said that he condemns this violence. He's called off -- and his people have called off any further demonstrations and have made very clear that this has to stop. (CROSSTALK) RICE: Now, and and same, frankly, in Tunisia, in Yemen, and, of course, in Libya, where the government has -- has gone out of its way to try to step up security and express deepest remorse for what has happened. We are quite popular in Libya, as you might expect, having been a major partner in their revolution. What transpired outside of our consulate in Benghazi was not an expression of deep-seated anti-Americanism on the part of the Libyan people. Quite the contrary. The counter-demonstrations, the outpouring of sympathy and support for Ambassador Stevens and for the United States, the government of Libya and -- and the people on the street saying how pained they are by this, is much more a reflection of the sentiment towards the United States than a small handful of heavily armed mobsters.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. TAPPER: That certainly, according to polling, is the case in Libya. Not the case in Egypt. And since you brought up President Morsi, let me try to get some clarification on something. President Obama was asked about the relationship with Egypt on Wednesday, and this is what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: I don't think that we would consider them an ally, but we don't consider them an enemy. They are a new government that is trying to find its way. (END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER: The United States has sent billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer money to Egypt over the last few decades. And by definition, as you know, according to the State Department, Egypt is a major non-NATO ally of the United States. Why would President Obama say Egypt is not an ally? RICE: Well, first of all, the president has been very clear and -- and everybody understands that Egypt is a very critical partner of the United States, has long been so. That relationship remains the same, and the president wasn't signaling any change in -- in the nature... TAPPER: Was he trying to nudge Morsi? RICE: The president wasn't signaling any change in the nature of our relationship. Obviously, the president had a conversation with President Morsi and a very productive one, in which he underscored that it's, of course, the responsibility of the Egyptian government as host to protect diplomatic personnel and facilities, including our own, and we saw that President Morsi, immediately after that, took dramatic steps to improve the security of our facilities in Cairo and elsewhere, and then went out and repeatedly made a number of very important and powerful statements condemning the violence and conveying the message that, however hateful such a video may be, there is absolutely no justification for violence against the United States or other Western partners. So what we've seen is that the president has been incredibly calm, incredibly steady, and incredibly measured in his approach to this set of developments. And his interventions, his leadership has ensured that in Egypt, in Yemen, in Tunisia, in Libya, and many other parts of the world, that leaders have come out and made very plain that there's no excuse for this violence. We heard Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey say the same, we heard the Grand Mufti in Saudi Arabia say the same, that there's no excuse for violence, that violence is to be condemned, and that governments have a responsibility to protect United States personnel and facilities and those of all foreign diplomats. TAPPER: I know you have to go, but very quickly, was the president in that interview trying to nudge President Morsi, \"Get your act together\"?

Tuesday, April 14, 2009 For some of us, Haiti is a neighbor. For others, a place of historic and cultural ties. For all of us, a test of collective commitment and resolve. Some may ask why a small nation in the middle of the Caribbean Sea should command our attention today. Why countries in the Western Hemisphere, Europe, the Middle East and Asia should offer assistance to Haiti in the midst of a global economic downturn that has shaken us all. We're gathered at this conference because what happens in Haiti will resound far beyond the Caribbean and beyond the Americas. The success or failure of this one small nation has economic, social and political implications, not just for its 9 million citizens, but for a region whose future will be shaped by the strength of our commitment to achieve economic recovery, political progress and wider opportunity for people from Portland to Porto Alegre to Port-au-Prince. The United States is here, first and foremost, because it is the right thing to do for our neighbor and friend. Our ties to Haiti reach back to the early years of both our nations and have endured for generations-through our struggles for independence; through the defeat of slavery in Haiti, which inspired slaves and abolitionists in the U.S. to press on with their fight for freedom; and more recently, through the hundreds of thousands of Haitians who emigrated to the United States and strengthened it through their contributions in politics, business, science, sports and culture-the benefits of which I experienced firsthand as a senator representing New York. We are also here because we are committed to creating a hemisphere in which every nation-no matter their present level of wealth or current political circumstances-is moving in the same direction, toward greater peace, prosperity, freedom and opportunity. With Haiti, we have the chance through global cooperation and collaboration to stand in solidarity with a people who are seeking to march forward. A nation where small investments and assistance from other countries are beginning to reap dividends in economic growth, wider access to health care, stronger governmental institutions, greater safety and security-and the higher quality of life that results when the material conditions of people's lives improve. Today, Haiti is the poorest nation in the hemisphere, with one of the region's biggest gaps between the haves and have- nots. But in 2006, Haiti had its highest economic growth since the 1990s. It is on track to reach the completion point for the IMF's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative in the next few months, which means significant debt relief is on the way, which will free up approximately $4 million a month-money that Haiti can invest directly in improving the lives of its people and building a future of self-sufficiency and confidence. Haiti has the region's highest rate of HIV/AIDS, the highest rate of maternal mortality, and the highest rate of child mortality. But the numbers of HIV infections and child and maternal deaths are all coming down. Not long ago, Haiti endured three decades of a brutal dictatorship. But the national and presidential elections in 2006 jump-started Haiti's democracy, and President Preval and Prime Minister Pierre Louis are seeking to maintain a strong commitment to democratic governance, which will take another step forward on Sunday with elections for the Senate. Like many nations, including the United States, Haiti struggles against crime, particularly the global scourge of drug trafficking. But reforms to improve policing, strengthen the justice system and fight corruption are now underway, and a peacekeeping force led by Brazil has helped bring stability to many Haitian communities. Haiti made these strides with help from its own citizens and many of the nations and institutions represented here today. And this progress did not come only through government-to-government partnerships, but also through links among businesses, universities, NG0s, religious and cultural groups, and individuals-the full range of resources and relationships, which is the heart of smart power. That trajectory of progress has been undermined by the combined winds of hurricanes and a global economic recession. Haiti is in danger of stalling. This conference gives us an opportunity to reignite its path to progress and work as a team-with Haiti at the helm-to advance a comprehensive, long-term strategy for Haiti's growth, by coordinating hemispheric and international efforts, targeting clear goals, and deploying our diverse skills and resources efficiently and effectively. President Preval and Prime Minister Pierre Louis have identified what help Haiti needs to get back on track. With these priorities as our guide and Haiti as our partner, we can make high-impact investments that will help lay the foundation for stronger democratic institutions, a vibrant civil society, and an open market economy that creates more stability, attracts international investment, and offers more jobs and wider economic opportunities for Haiti and our region as a whole. Now is the time to step up our investment in Haiti-not because the situation is so dire, but because the consequences of inaction could lead to significantly larger costs in both human and financial terms down the road. With $100, we can pay for a year of schooling for one Haitian child or immunize five. That's a tiny fraction of the cost of solving these problems if they escalate over time. The United States will target our support toward three areas that the Haitian government has requested, which are aimed at promoting conditions that are essential for national and regional progress. First, the Haitian people need to be secure. They must be able to travel safely to work and school and participate in the civic lives of their communities without fear of violence. Second, the country needs stronger infrastructure, particularly roads, which are the circulatory system of any robust economy. Meanwhile, the people of Haiti are ready to work, but jobs are in short supply. We can accomplish two things at once by putting people to work building roads and other infrastructure throughout Haiti. And third, last year's hurricanes blew a hole in the government's budget. Now Haiti is facing a huge deficit, which will make it harder to provide services in the short-term or fund major projects in the long-term. Their debt obligations further constrain their ability to lay the groundwork for the future. On each of these issues-security, jobs and infrastructure, and debt relief-the United States is lending its assistance and seeking to partner with other nations to maximize our collective impact. First, security. Effective international partnerships have already helped stem violence and improve security in Haiti. Cite Soleil, for example, was a no-man's-land for years, but today, violence has subsided and a new sense of freedom is felt in the streets. The Haitian National Police have been supported in their work by the UN peacekeeping operation in Haiti, which is the first in the hemisphere in which Latin American and Caribbean nations have participated. Brazil has led the mission with determination and skill. This level of engagement and collaboration is a major step forward for our region. But criminal networks operating in Haiti have not been eliminated. Haiti continues to fight drug traffickers who have made this country a distribution point for illegal drugs headed to the United States, Canada and Europe. Drug trafficking is a problem that involves many nations, all of which have a role to play in ending this deadly trade. That includes the United States. We will give $2 million to fight drug trafficking in Haiti through the Merida Initiative, a plan conceived by Mexico, Central America and the United States. This money will fund a secure communications network for the Haitian police; provide a maritime base, vehicles and operational support for police drug units; provide training to promote cross-border cooperation between Haiti and the Dominican Republic; and sharpen the investigation and prosecution of drug crimes. Once security is established, opportunity can take root. Nations from Canada to Spain to Japan offered generous assistance to help repair the damage from last year's storms. Now it is time to take the next step-to move beyond peacekeeping and disaster relief to long-term reconstruction and development. Haiti has the highest unemployment rate in the hemisphere; 70 percent of its people don't have jobs. It also has one of the region's highest population growth rates. Together, these trends have created what one development expert has called a \"youth tsunami\"-nearly 1 million youths are expected to come into the job market in the next five years. To spur the creation of jobs, the United States passed the HOPE Act in 2006, to give garments made in Haiti tariff-free access to the U.S. market. Last October, we extended this trade preference for another decade. Apparel is one of the largest sectors in Haiti's economy. We see great potential for job creation in this field, and we are gratified by Brazil's interest in supporting the Haitian apparel industry as well. But to build a diversified economy, Haiti needs more than trade deals. It also needs the infrastructure to support the flow of goods and services. The roads in Haiti are beyond inadequate; many communities are isolated by the lack of a passable road, which prevents people from holding jobs, children from going to school, and farmers from bringing their crops to market. Better roads could facilitate greater trade and bring more Haitians into the global economy. Haiti also needs better roads in tourist areas, to promote that sector of the economy. Other urgent infrastructure needs include digging water catchments to prevent floods, completing a garment workers' training center, and creating canals to help irrigation. As part of the $287 million in non-emergency assistance we will provide to Haiti this year, we have authorized $20 million in aid to generate jobs, to help people put their skills to work building their country's future. We look forward to working with Haiti to distribute that money quickly and effectively, to trigger a virtuous circle for long-term economic growth. All the fiscal responsibility in the world can't prevent a natural disaster. The hurricanes didn't just wash away crops and houses; they also washed away months of government planning for the future. Haiti is facing an approximately $50 million budget deficit, which could undermine Haiti's long-term ambitions as well as services that people depend on to survive. The United States will provide $20 million to pay Haiti's upcoming debt service obligations, to free Haiti to use its resources to fill that budget gap. [There is a fourth urgent need that the United States is committed to helping Haiti resolve. The combined effect of rising food prices globally and the destruction of crops by the hurricanes have exposed millions of Haitians to malnutrition and its destructive effects on health and productivity. Malnourished people are often too weak to work; chronically hungry children struggle to learn in school. Food insecurity is not only a source of suffering, but a direct threat to economic growth and global stability. The United States will provide a $15-million in-kind contribution of food to help Haiti as it continues to rebuild. ] These are some of the ways in which the United States is ready to partner with Haiti and other nations. But there are additional pieces of the larger mission that need support-from helping Haiti adapt to climate change so future hurricanes won't claim thousands of lives; to strengthening health systems; promoting sustainable agriculture; and developing civil society. This work is not only a matter for governments, but also a mission for our people. Here in the U.S., I have heard from many individuals and groups who care about Haiti and want to help it develop but don't know how to invest their time and money in a way that will make a real impact. We should think creatively about helping people outside government get involved in a meaningful way with Haiti's future. Our people are our most valuable resource, and their potential to help in places like Haiti has not yet been tapped. We know from empirical data that small investments go a long way. This is something I've seen for myself in my own visits to Haiti. I traveled there with my husband shortly after our wedding, and again years later as First Lady. I met a doctor who had emigrated to the United States and became a U.S. Air Force Colonel, but returned to his home town of Pignon to run a center for health, women's literacy and microcredit. He and his staff had few resources, but they offered a comprehensive range of services to thousands of clients. I visited a family-planning clinic where young people were trained to educate their peers about how to protect their health and prevent teen pregnancy. And I met with women from a group called Women in Democracy. These women had attended a global conference on women's leadership in Montevideo, Uruguay, and when they returned home, they created this organization to support Haitian women running for office. Eleven years later, their organization is larger and stronger than ever, and so is their mission. In addition to supporting women candidates, they also hold trade fairs for women entrepreneurs, run civic education programs to teach women their rights, support women journalists, and build connections between women throughout the Caribbean. These Haitian women remind us that we will never achieve real progress if we leave millions of people behind. And they demonstrate a powerful commitment on the part of the Haitian people to participate in and lead their nation's recovery. Our role is to support their work however we can, and to demonstrate through our actions our belief that their future is as important as our own. What happens next in Haiti will send a message to the world about the power of collaboration on behalf of every poor nation that has worked hard to earn a foothold in the global economy but has tumbled in recent months. On behalf of every man and woman in the hemisphere, from the northern expanses of Canada to the southern tip of Argentina, who is working harder than ever with fewer resources and for smaller rewards. and the children whose futures have been jeopardized by forces far beyond their control. let us prove our commitment to an economic recovery that reaches not only the citizens of our individual nations but all people everywhere."

On her first visit to Iraq as America's top diplomat, Clinton said the country has made tremendous strides despite the recent violence and continues to deserve support as the Obama administration moves to reduce the U.S. military presence there.

"C05761654"	"Barack Obama may support insurance mandate By CARRIE BUDOFF BROWN I 6/3/09 3:42 PM EDT Updated: 6/3/09 11:22 PM EDT As a presidential candidate, Barack Obama scoffed at Hillary Rodham Clinton's proposal to require people to buy health insurance. \"(If) they can't afford it, they just don't get it,\" Obama said during the primary, arguing that a mandate would not work unless insurance costs were lowered first. For the first time, Obama confirmed Wednesday that he plans to stake out a different position as president. In a letter to two leading Democratic senators, Obama said he could support a mandate on individuals to buy coverage, as long as Congress exempted those who could not afford it. This marks a shift from his stance during the campaign, when he tussled repeatedly with Clinton on the issue. She proposed an individual mandate, and he did not. \"I share the goal of ending lapses and gaps in coverage that make us less healthy and drive up everyone's costs, and I am open to your ideas on shared responsibility,\" Obama wrote. \"But I believe if we are going to make people responsible for owning health insurance, we must make health care affordable.\" \"If we do end up with a system where people are responsible for their own insurance, we need to provide a hardship waiver to exempt Americans who cannot afford it,\" Obama wrote. Detailing his positions on various health care proposals for the first time as president, Obama also said Americans should be able to choose between public and private insurance plans in a reformed health care system. \"I strongly believe that Americans should have the choice of a public health insurance option operating alongside private plans,\" he wrote. \"This will give them a better range of choices, make the health care market more competitive, and keep insurance companies honest.\" He offered qualified support for a mandate on employers to provide insurance or pay a fee to the government. Employers \"have a responsibility to support health insurance for their employees,\" Obama wrote, but small businesses should be exempt. Obama's positions on these issues were not entirely surprising, but his decision to weigh in before congressional Democratic leaders released a single bill was unexpected. Prior to the letter, Obama and his aides had declined to say specifically where he stood on various issues, including the public plan and individual mandate, saying they wanted Congress to lead the way in writing a bill. But Democrats have been anxious for the president to take a more public stance, and the letter provides the guidance that many in Congress had been craving as House and Senate committees move closer to releasing draft bills. \"The president says get it done. Get it done right because we only get one chance,\" said Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. \"The letter essentially synthesizes what the president is saying.\" He outlined the parameters in a letter to Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.). Obama's endorsement of a public insurance option could boost the controversial proposal and serve as catalyst for the Democratic base as the president kicks off a grassroots campaign Saturday. \"It's clear that the Republican resistance to a public plan hasn't softened President Obama's support for one,\" Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. \"This strengthens the hand of those of us advocating for a public option, which is the only way to keep the private insurers' feet to the fire.\" Despite almost uniform opposition from Republicans on the public plan, the president wrote in the letter that he remains \"hopeful that many Republicans\" would back an overhaul bill. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, struck an optimistic tone in a statement, saying the letter \"doesn't draw lines in the sand,\" and \"is helpful because of his statements that reform legislation needs to have bipartisan support.\" However, the letter is likely to incite opponents, who have been frustrated by Obama's lack of specifics. Indeed, on Thursday morning, Conservatives for Patients' Rights will begin airing a new TV ad called \"Bulldozer,\" which says a \"government-run plan\" will drive private insurers out of business and eliminate consumer choices.

Lots of people have expressed best wishes for you to me--Sean Wilentz, Joe Conason, Gene Lyons, etc--so if they haven't contacted you because you're behind a wall you should know that many, many people are thinking about you now. I spoke this morning to Gary Sick, who, you recall, was senior person on NSC during the Iran hostage crisis, and is now at Columbia. He has one of the best intelligence networks on Iran, 1,500 people, experts with extensive contacts, and many Iranians, deeply embedded in the unfolding events Gary tells me that Mousavi has evolved from a mild-mannered reformer to directly challenging the regime. Nobody, he says, knows where this will go, certainly not the Iranians. Khamenei has exposed himself and lost his aura of mystification, plunging into the arena as a political player. Mousavi has issued a new revolutionary manifesto, just translated; I enclose below Sick's report and analysis on it. This poses, Sick says, a new challenge to Khamenei. Does he let it stand? Does he answer it? Sick also says US diplomacy in fact can't accomplish anything with the regime until the crisis completely works its way out, which could take years. He points out that the first mass demonstrations against the Shah occurred a full year before his overthrow. He adds that the one thing the regime has learned fro m the Shah is not to be equivocal toward demonstrations. Two ideas, who knows, but here they are: 1. Though the regime uses Western protests to consolidate control, some of them contribute to its deep crisis of legitimacy. Sick says Obama's statement, for example, was good. He also cites a statement from Ban Ki Moon. If there would be a UN action, shouldn't it focus ont he human rights/violence aspect? A statement and/or resolution urging the regime to stop illegitimate violence of paramilitary militias? US shouldn't initiate. 2. Establish linkage in negotiations with Russians on Start between their objections to missile defense outposts in Poland and Czech Republic (especially if we plan to give them up) with Russian arms sales to Iran. Get well. See Sick analysis below. Sid 5ousavi's New Revolutionary Manifesto by Gary Sick June 21, 2009 I 10:51am — L Alfred, Sipa / AP Photo The Iranian protest movement reached a tipping point today, writes Gary Sick, • the key White House offical during the 1979 hostage crisis, and what has emerged is nothing short of a platform for a true Islamic democracy. Plus, read more insight on Iran's election from other Daily Beast writers. Today, Mir Hossein Mousavi, the presidential candidate who has come to represent the democratic aspirations of the Iranian people, issued a formal statement. Although he denounces the \"lies and fraud\" of the leadership, particularly in the recent election, he views the fraudulent election as only as the symptom of something far more serious. He describes a revolution gone wrong, a revolution that was originally based on attention to the voice of the peo ple but has resulted in \"forcing an unwanted government on the nation.\" It is apparent from this statement that Mousavi's movement—and Mousavi himself—have evolved enormously in the past week. This moment is \"a turning point,\" he says, and he defines the movement that is forming around him as having a \"historical mission\" to accomplish nothing less than \"renewing the life of the nation\" according to its own ideals. He acknowledges, interestingly, that his own voice at the beginning was less \"eloquent\" than he would have wished and that the people were ahead of him in turning the movement green. But now he accepts the \"burden of duty put on our shoulders by the destiny of generations and ages.\" He denounces both extremes of the political spectrum: on one hand those who believe that \"Islamic government is the same as Tyranny of the Rightful;\" and on the other, those who \"consider religion and Islam to be blockers for realization of republicanism,\" i.e. those who believe that democracy is incompatible with Islam. Mousavi says his call for annulment of the election and a revote, supervised by an impartial national body, \"is a given right.\" The objective is nothing less than \"to achieve a new type of political life in the country.\" That is truly a revolutionary statement. He says he will stand by the side of all those seeking \"new solutions\" in a n on-violent way. He accepts the principles and the institutions of the Islamic Republic, including the Revolutionary Guard and the basij, but denounces \"deviations and deceptions.\" He demands reform \"that returns us to the pure principles of the Islamic Revolution.\" He calls for freedom of expression in all its forms, and says that if the government permits people to express their views freely, \"there won't be a need for the presence of military and regulatory forces in the streets.\" It is apparent from this statement that Mousavi's movement—and Mousavi himself—have evolved enormously in the past week. The candidate started as a mild-mannered reformer. After the searing events of the past several days, he has dared to preach a counter sermon to Khamene'i's lecture on Islamic government. Although he never mentions the Leader by name, there is no overlooking the direct contradiction of his arguments. This open opposition to the Leader by a political figure is unprecedented. • Mousavi has in fact issued a manifesto for a new vision of the Islamic Republic. The repression and disdain of the government has brought the opposition to a place they probably never dreamed of going. And no one knows where any of the parties are likely to go next. But for outside observers, it is like standing on the edge of a glacier and feeling the ice begin to crack under your feet. Gary Sick served on the National Security Council staff under Presidents Ford, Carter and Reagan. He was the principal White House aide for Iran during the Iranian Revolution and the hostage crisis and is the author of two books on U.S.-Iranian relations. Mr. Sick is a captain (ret.) in the US.

"C05763809"	"Below is Palau's statement on the recent meeting in the required free association review. The fourth is the key paragraph. Jake, I'll call. Jeff 202-343-2905 o, A Compact of Free Association replaced the United States administration of Palau, islands which the U.S. took in war and subsequently administered for the United Nations. The Compact, which was signed in 1986 and took effect October 1, 1994, includes provisions of various duration. Some are to last at least 50 years, including full U.S. military authority -- although the power of the U.S. to deny access to Palau and its extensive waters by the military of any other nation is to continue in perpetuity. The amounts and types of U.S. budgetary and programmatic assistance to Palau under the Compact are specified for 15 years, but the Compact requires reviews of its terms and the entire relationship on its 15th, 30th, and 40th anniversaries. The reviews are to consider the operating requirements of the Government of Palau and the islands' development. The Compact also commits the U.S. to acting on the findings and to promoting Palau's long-term economic development. A Palauan delegation that included Vice President Kerai Mariur, Chief Representative for Compact Review Joshua Koshiba, Minister of Health Dr. Stevenson J. Kuartei, Palau Community College President Dr. Patrick Tellei, Ambassador to the U.S. Hersey Kyota, Representative to the United Nations Stuart Beck, and their consultants met in Honolulu on July 8-9 in connection with the 15th Anniversary Review with an American delegation that included Department of State Office of Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific Islands Affairs Alcy Frelick, the head of the US Delegation, and representatives of the Departments of the Interior and Defense and the Weather and Postal Services. The U.S. delegation made positive statements on a few matters and agreed to discuss some others further. A number of the U.S. delegation's statements, however, evidenced a need for greater study by some U.S. officials of the intent as well as the letter of the Compact, the relationship as a whole, Palau's economic situation and fiscal responsibility commitments, and Palau's contributions to the U.S. and to international harmony -- including sacrifice by Palauans in the U.S. military, the UN international peacekeeping force and Palau's strategic location and posture, and Palau's positions in the U.N. Palau is grateful for its partnership with the U.S. and wants to continue in the association as called for by the Compact, deepen the relationship, and develop its capacities as a freely associated state. It appreciates the more positive expressions of U.S. Secretaries of State Clinton and of the Interior Salazar and congressional leaders of both political parties. Palau fully trusts that reflection will result in an approach to the relationship consistent with the Compact and to positions befitting the great nation that is the United States. Recognizing that the questions of the association are relatively small and unique for the Government of the U.S. and that the U.S. faces many and extraordinary challenges at this time, Palau understands why more deliberation by U.S. officials can be needed. Because of this, because of the confidence that it has in the United States, and because it would not be productive to elaborate with others on the conversations at this stage, Palau's representatives are confining additional comment to official communications.

"C05764001"	"pvervee Secretary Clinton — I understand you are going to Kenya next week and while I know the trip is primarily focused on trade issues, I wanted to flag an issue for you because I know it is near and dear to your heart. Kenya has one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in Africa — it is illegal unless a woman's life is at risk and criminalizes both the woman and the provider. Two years ago, Kenyan authorities imprisoned a doctor and two nurses, falsely accusing them of providing illegal abortions. After a year in prison, the providers were found innocent and released, but it galvanized the legal and provider community who formed a coalition to make abortion less restrictive. It will come as no surprise to you that, as a result of their abortion law, Kenya has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in all of Africa, with an estimated 800 women a day seeking the procedure, often through dangerous means. Kenya is restarting a long-stalled constitutional review process and they hope to produce a final Constitution by next year. Religious groups are on a concerted crusade to include new language in the Constitution which would codify that \"life begins at conception\". The current Constitution is largely silent on the issue. If this fetal personhood amendment goes forward, it would place Kenya in the small community of nations with such a provision. It would clearly mark Kenya as out of stop with countries attempting to institutionalize the African Union's Maputo Protocol, one of the most progressive regional documents on women, development and reproductive rights, and with the vast majority of African countries in general. For a country trying to regain the momentum of stability and success it enjoyed until recently, such a policy imposition would be a regression for women's rights and for the country writ large. I went to Kenya last month to work with the coalition that has formed to strategize against the Constitutional amendment and to work toward a less restrictive abortion law. I also visited several of our clinics and providers in Nairobi and in nearby villages where Planned Parenthood has programs to train providers in post abortion care. You have seen this a million times in your travels around the world, so I don't need to tell you how poignant the stories were of the lives saved and lost, the bravery in standing up to constant government harassment, and the fear of what this potential Constitutional amendment will mean to the provision of safe medical services. I know it is asking a lot, but if there is any way that you could draw attention to this issue when you are in Kenya, you would be even more of my personal hero than you already are. It is our hope that if Kenya knows the world is watching they may be more careful in how they proceed. Of course we would be happy to help you in any way if you decide you want to do something on this while you are there. There is also a Congressional delegation going to Kenya the week of August 8th and we are working on them to have a side meeting on this issue as well. As always, thank you so much for all you do. We are all so grateful that you are there! All best, Laurie Laurie Rubiner Vice President of Public Policy and Advocacy Planned Parenthood Federation of America (202) 973-4863 office"

We will ask the Post to release the letter to journalists in Colombo once it is received. I will schedule a press briefing at the Foreign Press Center early this week, which will attract a good number of Asian journalists, and make sure the question is asked so we can put it in proper context. We will have it for guidance in the Main State briefing if asked. PJ BEGIN TEXT Questions have been raised regarding remarks by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on September 30 before the United Nations Security Council on the adoption of a resolution to combat sexual violence in armed conflict. In her statement, she said that we have seen rape used as a tactic before in a number of countries, including Sri Lanka. Regarding the Secretary's reference to Sri Lanka in her address, we want to be clear. Over the course of the difficult conflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), stretching into this decade, the State Department as well as credible human rights organizations reported numerous cases of rape and sexual violence in Sri Lanka, particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government. This was the basis for the Secretary's statement. At the same time, in the most recent phase of the conflict, from 2006 to 2009, though we remained deeply concerned about reports of extrajudicial killings, disappearances and mistreatment of detainees, we have not received reports that rape and sexual abuse were used as tools of war, as they clearly have in other conflict areas around the world. We hope that this clarification puts the issue in its proper context. These questions should not detract from the specific actions that Sri Lanka needs to take now. With the end of the military conflict, Secretary Clinton believes strongly that Sri Lanka must focus to the future and move forward on the promotion of peace and the protection of human rights. The government of Sri Lanka should release more than 250,000 displaced persons who are still confined in camps, and lead a process of genuine political and social reconciliation. The United States stands ready to assist and support the people of Sri Lanka with these critical challenges."

"C05764250"	"From your clips: US Responds To Sri Lanka Protest Over Clinton Remark (AFP) Monday, October 5, 2009 AFP WASHINGTON (AFP) - The United States, responding to protests from Sri Lanka over remarks by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, said it had no recent evidence of women being raped while in Sri Lankan government custody. In a letter addressed to Sri Lanka's Minister of Foreign Affairs Rohitha Bogollagama, the State Department noted that the US government and international human rights groups over the years had detailed \"numerous cases of rape and sexual violence in Sri Lanka, particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government.\" However, the letter signed by Melanne Verveer, ambassador at large for global women's issues at the State Department said that \"in the most recent phase of the conflict, from 2006 to 2009 ... we have not received reports that rape and sexual abuse were used as tools of war, as they clearly have in other conflict area around the world.\" \"We hope that this clarification puts the issue in its proper context,\" the letter said, adding that Washington remains concerned about extrajudicial killings, disappearances and detainee abuse in Sri Lanka. \"Secretary Clinton believes that Sri Lanka must focus to the future and move forward on the promotion of peace and the protection of human rights,\" the letter said. Sri Lanka lodged its protest with the US embassy in Colombo over the remarks made by Clinton last month to the United Nations Security Council. \"We've seen rape used as a tactic of war before in Bosnia, Burma and Sri Lanka and elsewhere,\" the US secretary of state had said during a resolution calling for an end to sexual violence in armed conflict, according to published reports of Clinton's remarks. Her comments sparked an outcry across Sri Lanka, where government forces in May crushed Tamil Tiger rebels after decades of fighting. Colombo faced condemnation for its handling of the final stages of the war against Tiger rebels and managed to stave off a Security Council resolution calling for war crimes investigations thanks to the vetoes of China and Russia. The United Nations has said that over 7,000 civilians perished in the first four months of intense fighting this year. Sri Lanka is now facing international pressure to free 250,000 ethnic Tamil civilians who managed to escape the fighting but are now held in internment camps while they are screened to see whether they were rebels.

"C05764805"	"Magazine The Power Grid Back From the Death Panel How the public option, helped by a congressman looking for an issue and a shrewdly silent White House, returned from the brink. •Published Oct 11, 2009 On the night last week when much of Washington was joyously weeping over the seal of approval bestowed on the Baucus health-care bill by the Congressional Budget Office, Anthony Weiner was in his quarters in the Rayburn Building, merrily pissing all over the legislation instead. \"It's just too weak,\" he told me. \"It doesn't do enough It doesn't achieve real cost savings. There's no real competition. It's pretty much a wish list for the insurance companies.\" And those were merely Weiner's substantive criticisms of the bill. His political assessment was even harsher: \"It's effectively dead,\" he said. Not a droplet of Weiner's dismissal of the Baucus plan came as any sort of shock; he's been trashing the Senate Finance Committee's efforts for weeks. What's surprising is that anyone gives a fig what Weiner has to say about the topic in the first place. Until six months ago, after all, the congressman was known more for his yearning to acquire the keys to Gracie Mansion than his mastery of the arcana of Medicare reimbursement rates. In fact, as Weiner would be the first to admit, his interest in, knowledge of, and record on health-care reform were perilously close to nonexistent. And yet, since May, when he concluded that taking on Mike Bloomberg was a challenge that went beyond the Sisyphean into the realm of the just plain silly, Weiner has emerged as one of the few real stars in the marathon health-care debate: the clearest and savviest (and, as always, loudest and noodgiest) voice in favor of the public option. And though it's plain that whatever bill eventually lands on Barack Obama's desk—and, yes, I think the odds are now close to overwhelming that a big pile of health-care paper will wind up there—won't be anything close to Weiner's single-payer dream, his role in framing the terms of the discussion has been more than salutary. In some non-obvious ways, you could argue that it's been essential. I should confess at the outset that I have a long-standing soft spot for Weiner, whom I first met more than twenty years ago, when he was a budding Chuck Schumer protégé and we played on the same Capitol Hill softball team. Weiner then was strikingly similar to Weiner now: amped-up, ambitious, wicked smart, forever gauging all the angles, unafraid of being (actually, proud of being) a royal pain in the tuchis. All the qualities, in other words, that have served him so well in the wrangle over health care. Weiner describes his efflorescence on the subject as a matter of opportunism, in the best sense of the word. \"This was one of those unusual issues where we really didn't have a mother ship that was directing the message, and that created an entrepreneurial environment,\" he says. \"You didn't have the president out there speaking clearly about what he wanted. And among my colleagues, there weren't people that jumped out who either had a comfort with the material or weren't intimidated by the blowback\" Weiner laughs. \"Frankly, I like the blowback. After my thirteenth town- hall meeting, someone on my staff said, 'I can't tell if you're a sadist or a masochist.— Weiner is right about the nature of the vacuum that he smartly stepped in to fill, but there are at least two other proximate causes for it that should be added to his list: the illness and death of Ted Kennedy and the migration of Hillary Clinton out of the Senate and into Foggy Bottom, which deprived the debate of what would have been its two dominant liberal protagonists. For Weiner, Clinton's absence and its implications carry a personal twist; he is engaged to Huma Abedin, Hillary's longtime personal aide. \"It's a weird irony that I'm kind of part of the family now and this has become my issue,\" Weiner says. \"If Hillary had stayed in the Senate, I would never have had this opening.\" Weiner allows that he's discussed the health-care battle with Clinton; what she's told him he will not say. But one imagines she approves of the cleverness and chutzpa he's displayed—especially in drawing an explicit analogy between the public option and Medicare, an equation that not only increases support for the proposal among voters but flushes out the phoniness of the Republican howls against a \"government takeover\" of health care. And one similarly imagines Madame Secretary's chagrin at watching the Obama White House pursue a dance-of-the-seven-veils strategy explicitly designed to be the antithesis of the one she employed back in 1993 and 1994. Weiner's view of the administration's approach hasn't exactly been approving—a point he's made abundantly and consistently clear over the past months. On the eve of Obama's September speech before a joint session of Congress, Weiner cracked that \"up to now, the messaging from the White House has been done by Sybil ... They seem to have a different perspective on this every couple of hours.\" And he's apparently had no change of heart. \"The president has been a miserable messenger on this by and large,\" he tells me. Such criticisms haven't gone unnoticed at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, in no small part because Weiner—in a testament to his consistency, lunacy, inability to shut up, or all three—hasn't shied away from making them directly. Indeed, on a recent flight back to Washington from New York on Air Force One, I'm told by one congressman who witnessed the scene, Weiner got into a testy"

"C05764892"	"Barack Obama snubs Gordon Brown over private talks White House spurned five requests from PM's aides for bilateral meeting Gordon Brown and Barack Obama at a joint news conference at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London in April 2009. Photograph: Jason Reed/Reufers Gordon Brown lurched from being hailed as a global statesman to intense embarrassment tonight, after it emerged US President Barack Obama had turned down no fewer than five requests from Downing Street to hold a bilateral meeting at the United Na tions in New York or at the G20 summit starting in Pittsburgh today. The prime minister, eager to portray himself as a leading player on the international stage in America this week, was also forced to play down suggestions from inside his own party that he might step down early, either due to ill health or deteriorating eyesight. There have been tensions between the White House and No 10 for weeks over Brown's handling of the Scottish government's decision to release the man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi. Brown's efforts to secure a prestigious primetime slot for his keynote speech at the general assembly in New York were also thwarted when the Libyan leader, Colonel Gaddafi, delivered a 100-minute speech to the UN, massively running over Brown's 15 minute slot. Brown had not only been seeking a bilateral meeting with Obama, but feelers were also sent out to hold a joint press conference, an event that would have boosted Brown's efforts to offer himself as a linchpin of international diplomacy. Government sources said that Britain even changed its policy on swine flu immunisation in Africa to match that of the Obama administration last week, in an attempt to rebuild relations. No 10 denied there had been any hint of a snub, saying Obama and Brown had plenty of chances to talk as they sat next to one another at the summits. They insisted they were working closely on issues such as future economic regulation, bankers' bonuses, nuclear non-proliferation and climate change. Brown himself insisted: \"I do say that the special relationship is strong, it continues to strengthen.\" But Obama has held bilateral meetings in New York with the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, and the new Japanese prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama. News of the five spurned approaches compounded a miserable day for Brown at home which saw a parliamentary aide resign over the prime minister's refusal to sack Lady Scotland, the attorney general, after she was fined £5,000 for employing an illegal immigrant, as well as a withering attack by the former home secretary Charles Clarke. Stephen Hesford, Labour MP for Wirral West, told Brown in a resignation letter: \"In my view, the facts of the case do not matter. It is the principle which counts, particularly at a time when the public's trust of Whitehall is uncertain to say the least. We have to be seen to be accountable.\" Brown was also savaged by Charles Clarke, who told the Evening Standard that in his view Brown's leadership risked letting \"the whole Labour ship crash on to the rocks of May 2010 [the expected date of the general election] and sink for a very long time\". He said he hoped rumours that Brown would quit would come true. \"I think his own dignity ought to look to that kind of solution.\" In two interviews , Brown was forced for the first time to field questions about his health. \"My sight is not at all deteriorating,\" he told NBC. Asked on BBC Radio 5 Live whether he might quit for health reasons, the prime minister replied: \"I am healthy and I am very fit. I run a lot to keep fit and I will continue to keep fit. \"I keep going. I have got a job to do. I have got work to do. We have got to meet this challenge.\" In his own speech to the UN, Obama promised an end to the unilateralism marked by the previous Bush administration, an approach that saw US and Britain working in tandem. In remarks that suggest Obama will focus on broadening American alliances across the globe, he said: \"The time has come for the world to move in a new direction ... a new era of engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect.\" Last week, the White House had unusually briefed that Obama had told B rown in a phone conversation that he disapproved of the release of the Lockerbie bomber on compassionate grounds, something No 10 had not highlighted. Megrahi was released on the basis that he had three months to live, and then received a hero's welcome as he returned to Tripoli. Brown had said he respected the release, but insisted undertakings by the Libyans that the return would be low- key had been broken. In an attempt to distance himself from the Libyans, Brown moved to toughen his position against Colonel Gaddafi after Libya's leader theatrically tore up the UN charter in his address. Gaddafi said the security council should be renamed \"the terror council\". Brown countered in his speech in New York later: \"I am here to reaffirm the UN charter, not to tear it up. I call on everyone to support its universal principles.\" He urged world leaders to recognise that the next six months presented tests on climate change and terrorism that were as huge as the banking crisis. On climate change he said: \"If we miss this opportunity to protect our planet, we cannot hope for a second chance some time in the future. There will be no retrospective global agreement to undo the damage we have caused. This is the moment now to limit and reverse climate change we are inflicting on future generations.\" He added: \"If the poorest and most vulnerable are going to be able to adapt, if the emerging economies are going to embark on low-carbon development paths, if the forest nations are going to slow and stop deforestation, then the richer countries must contribute financially.\" No 10 again denied that the prime minister had been snubbed last night. A spokesman said the stories were \"without foundation. As we have said throughout the week, the prime minister and President Obama are having a number of meetings throughout the week. These included a wide-ranging discussion following last night's climate change dinner. They will also be co-chairing an important meeting on Thursday on Pakistan and the fight against terrorism. As the prime minister has already said, there will be further meetings at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh.\""

"C05766022"	"Cover story in the Economist this week. Very big issue when I was in Japan and Korea. Korean parliamentarians want to get women and economic growth on the G20 agenda when they have the lead next year and we are advocating for Japan to advance the issue at APEC which they are leading this year. On another note, so sad about Smith Bagley. He was a good person and was one of your biggest fans. Women and work We did it! Dec 30th 2009 From The Economist print edition The rich world's quiet revolution: women are gradually taking over the workplace Getty Images AT A time when the world is short of causes for celebration, here is a candidate: within the next few months women will cross the 50% threshold and become the majority of the American workforce. Women already make up the majority of university graduates in the OECD countries and the majority of professional workers in several rich countries, including the United States. Women run many of the world's great companies, from PepsiCo in America to Areva in France. Women's economic empowerment is arguably the biggest social change of our times. Just a generation ago, women were largely confined to repetitive, menial jobs. They were routinely subjected to casual sexism and were expected to abandon their careers when they married and had children. Today they are running some of the organisations that once treated them as second-class citizens. Millions of women have been given more control over their own lives. And millions of brains have been put to more productive use. Societies that try to resist this trend—most notably the Arab countries, but also Japan and some southern European countries—will pay a heavy price in the form of wasted talent and frustrated citizens. This revolution has been achieved with only a modicum of friction (see article). Men have, by and large, welcomed women's invasion of the workplace. Yet even the most positive changes can be incomplete or unsatisfactory. This particular advance comes with two stings. The first is that women are still under- represented at the top of companies. Only 2% of the bosses of America's largest companies and 5% of their peers in Britain are women. They are also paid significantly less than men on average. The second is that juggling work and child-rearing is difficult. Middle-class couples routinely complain that they have too little time for their children. But the biggest losers are poor children— particularly in places like America and Britain that have combined high levels of female participation in the labour force with a reluctance to spend public money on child care. Dealing with the juggle These two problems are closely related. Many women feel they have to choose between their children and their careers. Women who prosper in high-pressure companies during their 20s drop out in dramatic numbers in their 30s and then find it almost impossible to regain their earlier momentum. Less-skilled women are trapped in poorly paid jobs with hand-to-mouth child-care arrangements. Motherhood, not sexism, is the issue: in America, childless women earn almost as much as men, but mothers earn significantly less. And those mothers' relative poverty also disadvantages their children. Demand for female brains is helping to alleviate some of these problems. Even if some of the new theories about warm-hearted women making inherently superior workers are bunk (see article), several trends favour the more educated sex, including the \"war for talent\" and the growing flexibility of the workplace. Law firms, consultancies and banks are rethinking their \"up or out\" promotion systems because they are losing so many able women. More than 90% of companies in Germany and Sweden allow flexible working. And new technology is making it easier to redesign work in all sorts of family-friendly ways. Women have certainly performed better over the past decade than men. In the European Union women have filled 6m of the 8m new jobs created since 2000. In America three out of four people thrown out of work since the \"mancession\" began have been male. And the shift towards women is likely to continue: by 2011 there will be 2.6m more female than male university students in America. The light hand of the state All this argues, mostly, for letting the market do the work. That has not stopped calls for hefty state intervention of the Scandinavian sort. Norway has used threats of quotas to dramatic effect. Some 40% of the legislators there are women. All the Scandinavian countries provide plenty of state-financed nurseries. They have the highest levels of female employment in the world and far fewer of the social problems that plague Britain and America. Surely, comes the argument, there is a way to speed up the revolution—and improve the tough lives of many working women and their children? If that means massive intervention, in the shape of affirmative-action programmes and across-the-board benefits for parents of all sorts, the answer is no. To begin with, promoting people on the basis of their sex is illiberal and unfair, and stigmatises its beneficiaries. And there are practical problems. Lengthy periods of paid maternity leave can put firms off hiring women, which helps explain why most Swedish women work in the public sector and Sweden has a lower proportion of women in management than America does. But there are plenty of cheaper, subtler ways in which governments can make life easier for women. Welfare states were designed when most women stayed at home. They need to change the way they operate. German schools, for instance, close at midday. American schools shut down for two months in the summer. These things can be changed without huge cost. Some popular American charter schools now offer longer school days and shorter summer holidays. And, without going to Scandinavian lengths, America could invest more in its children: it spends a lower share of its GDP on public child-care than almost any other rich country, and is the only rich country that refuses to provide mothers with paid maternity leave. Barack Obama needs to measure up to his campaign rhetoric about \"real family values\". Still, these nagging problems should not overshadow the dramatic progress that women have made in recent decades. During the second world war, when America's menfolk were off at the front, the government had to summon up the image of Rosie the Riveter, with her flexed muscle and \"We Can Do It\" slogan, to encourage women into the workforce. Today women are marching into the workplace in ever larger numbers and taking a sledgehammer to the remaining glass ceilings."

"C05766082"	"I. Introduction The next six months will be a critical time for establishing the Department's leadership in bridging relationships for U.S. intergovernmental officials and their foreign counterparts, defining the mission and role of the Office of the Special Representative for Global Intergovernmental Affairs (\"S/SRGIA\"), and outlining an agenda that serves the needs of the Department and these officials. Our approach will be strategic and integrated, working in collaboration with Department bureaus and USAID offices to strengthen and deliver on the Secretary's and Administration's priorities. II. Key Objectives The Special Representative for Global Intergovernmental Affairs will serve the global needs of the U.S. intergovernmental officials and the entities they represent. The S/SRGIA will also connect U.S. state and local officials with intergovernmental officials around the world, promote local capacity building investments and programs to enhance country-led processes, and facilitate the needs and goals of intergovernmental officials here and abroad consistent with Department priorities. III. Next Steps This work plan describes activities that the S/SRGIA plans to initiate, grow and implement in the next six months. To place the Work Plan in context, we describe below S/SRGIA' s work-planning process. A. Establish S/SRGIA Mission and Role in the Department. Currently, no one and no office in the State Department has accountability to serve the needs of intergovernmental officials, (e.g., Governors, Mayors, local elected leaders, the entities that represent them) with respect to their global affairs portfolios. State and local officials' concerns are typically routed on an individual basis through bureaus with the results reflecting , the priority of the person in the bureau's estimation or the nature of the request. Priority activities will be as follows: 1 Sensitive But Unclassified • Confirm the Secretary's support to focus on priority issues and countries; • Join Department's meetings and conversations with visiting foreign state and local representatives and dignitaries to establish S/SRGIA's role; • Strengthen support on global intergovernmental affairs issues internally in the State Department, by explaining the value of these stakeholders; • Track deployment of resources assisting intergovernmental officials and leverage the State Department's collective U.S. and global intergovernmental relationships; • Follow and interpret international issues (e.g., food security, global health, climate change, trade and economic development, energy) of importance to state governments; • Promote dialogue between the Department (e.g., USAID, EEB, ECA, Public Private Partnerships, Global Women's Issues, Consular Affairs, MCC and targeted Regional Bureaus) and external constituents (e.g., Governors, Mayors, local elected officials, and the entities that they represent) for more effective partnerships and relationships; and • Collaborate with the Public Diplomacy and INR to create a survey of foreign intergovernmental affairs officials to determine their needs and engage U.S. intergovernmental officials to learn how the Department should help to further their global goals. B. Conduct Stakeholder Outreach: Obtain first-hand understanding of the needs of U.S. intergovernmental officials. State economies are increasingly globalized, and more and more U.S. companies are competing in international markets and against firms worldwide. As the principal stewards of their states' economic success, Governors recognize that the global marketplace presents both challenges and opportunities and that states must address both to ensure their continued competitiveness. Thus, S/SRGIA will develop its global intergovernmental affairs outreach activities in partnership with its participating US and other intergovernmental and international organizations. U.S. national organizations who serve governmental authorities include but are not limited to the following: • National Governors Association; • National Lt. Governors Association; • U.S. Conference of Mayors; • National League of Cities; • National Association of Counties/Large Urban County Caucus; • National Association of States Attorney Generals; • National State Legislatures; and • Councils of State Governments. Outreach is essential to many aspects of the Department's activities. S/SRGIA's outreach objective is to promote and increase the general awareness of the benefits of the State Department efforts in global intergovernmental affairs, especially among decision makers and policy makers, educational entities, non-governmental organizations, public-interest groups and public agencies. S/SRGIA will provide international outreach services to state and local elected officials in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and all other inhabited U.S. territories. Specific objectives are to: 2 Sensitive But Unclassified • Build state by state profiles, thus creating a set of priorities and identifying opportunities for collaboration with state and local officials on their global projects and Department priorities; • Establish our target list of public officials to assist and nurture relationships with principals and the organizations that represent them and their global needs; • Create dialogue with the Governors and Mayors in preparation for the NGA and Mayors Washington conferences in the fall; • Travel to conferences and meetings within the United States and countries abroad required to implement the Department's global intergovernmental affairs agenda; • Develop a network of leaders, to collaborate and create partnerships; • Coordinate meetings between Department of State experts and state and local officials; • Support targeted elected officials trade missions and other official trips abroad; • Develop a strategy for deliverables such as multilateral pacts and Memorandum of Understandings on key State Department priorities that we will sign with responsible parties; and • Collaboration with EEB, to partner with them to engage state and local government leaders in the bureaus enhanced commercial diplomacy efforts (e.g. the Administration's National Export Initiative and EEB/Consular Affairs Business Visa Facilitation initiative, etc.). C. Conduct Stakeholder Outreach: Obtain first-hand understanding of the needs of middle and senior foreign intergovernmental affairs officials. Currently, ECA conducts a significant number of exchanges with foreign and domestic government officials. None of ECA's programs target regions with the objective of enhancing another country's government systems because the bureau's authorities do not permit any type of training since everything must be done under the auspices of enhancing mutual understanding. The most visible ECA program is the International Visitor Leadership Program which in FY09 brought in 1,390 foreign government officials at the state, city and national levels to gain knowledge around the US political system and culture. To date, the bureau estimates the same number of government visitors in FY10. Thus, S/SRGIA will develop its global intergovernmental affairs outreach activities in partnership with international organizations. International organizations who serve local governmental authorities include but are not limited to the following: • United Cities and Local Governments; • Metropolis; • The World Urban Forum; • UN-HABITAT; • Latin American and Caribbean Ministers of Housing and Urbanization; • UN Advisory Committee of Local Authorities; • The World Mayors Council on Climate Change; 3 Sensitive But Unclassified • Sister Cities International; • Local Governments for Sustainability; and • Municipal Development Partnerships which targets governments in Africa. Priority activities will be as follows: • S/SRGIA will collaborate with Public Diplomacy to conduct stakeholder outreach with strategic countries — e.g. Af, Pak, Iraq — and key emerging powers (Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria) and developing countries (Rwanda, Ethiopia, Kenya, etc.) to obtain first-hand understanding of the needs of middle and senior foreign intergovernmental affairs officials; • Collaborate with [NR to assist us in gaining a better understanding of what foreign intergovernmental affairs officials want to engage with their US counterparts ranging from engagement on a host of common policy concerns, opportunities, programs and connections. D. Provide Leadership for Department Intergovernmental Capacity Building. One of our largest challenges in most developing countries is the lack of capacity in the government below the President and Prime Minister level. As the Department seeks to implement development programs or conduct diplomacy, there is often limited local counterpart capacity to do so with or to empower. S/SRGIA will work with USAID and State bureaus and offices to provide connections and leadership development to build the capacity of intergovernmental officials in countries around the world. Currently, millions of dollars of USAID and ECA grants that support capacity building are typically carried out by contractors and have results that are not transparent in their reporting or impact. S/SRGIA will partner with existing offices to provide leadership for the investment in this space, accountability for the outcomes and programming, and foster relationships between intergovernmental officials here in the US with foreign partners to mentor and model what is needed. S/SRGIA capacity building strategies will primarily be based on best practices derived from studying successful and less-successful approaches. Within the next six months, S/SRGIA will work in partnership with Department and USAID bureaus and resources. Priority activities will be as follows: • Identify State Department investments, canvass additional State Department dedicated resources other than grant-making and assess the strength of the current environment needed to advance the S/SRGIA's Secretary capacity building agenda for state and local leaders; participate in QDDR process regarding this agenda; • Develop an agenda for a high-level retreat on the formulation of a National Capacity Development Strategy to present achievements to date, lessons learned and proposals for institutional capacity development going forward; • Work with the Chiefs of Missions and other diplomats in countries where capacity building is critical to the success of our diplomacy and development efforts; 4 Sensitive But Unclassified • Amplify and sustain high quality and results driven support to institutional capacity development by assisting in advocating for increased funding and building public-private partnerships; • Prioritize discrete initiatives to \"fast track\", based on importance, regional priorities (e.g., Asia, Africa and Latin America), assessment of readiness, impact and feasibility and translate priorities into actionable interventions; • Develop a network of experts involved in existing capacity-building initiatives related to global intergovernmental affairs and build partnerships; • Define a coordinated approach and institutional responsibilities for supporting the GIA capacity building initiative; and • Identify opportunities for further collaboration with state and local officials on their projects and Department priorities. IV. Administrative Activities • Standardize requests for assistance with projects related to policy, business, trade, consular affairs, etc.; and • Link the Department website to states websites and trade and development office websites. V. Budget and Staffing S/SRGIA will require a budget and staffing to fulfill its mission. VI. Assessment of Progress The short term goal will be to engage U.S. intergovernmental officials about their global concerns. The S/SRGIA office will become a significant resource for high-level State Department engagement for U.S. state and local elected officials. The benefits of this new office will be immediate and grow over time as our engagement deepens. Assisting US states and local governments to expand their exports, promote locations for foreign investment and for participation in State Department priorities are some of the short term benefits we hope to achieve with respect to U.S. intergovernmental officials. With respect to the global intergovernmental officials, in the short term, we expect to work with our Regional Bureaus and Offices, (e.g., USAID, ECA, EEB, etc.) to assess the current state of play and assist us with how we better target and leverage our assistance to this constituency. In the longer term, institutionally, we need to sustain relationships with our embassies and missions overseas, so that they can assist state and local officials and their constituencies to expand their global business base. As related to our national capacity building strategy, in the long term, we seek to empower and educate and build relationships with state and local officials abroad. We also seek accountability for the outcomes of the programming and will provide leadership for future investments. Going forward, we will tailor these investments to address regional State Department priorities. 5 Sensitive But Unclassified In addition, since there is a lack of USG harmonization of all of the relevant USG programs, having S/SRGIA be the designated coordinator will allow DOS to take the lead in synchronizing government wide programs that engage foreign government officials. This will be another long term goal for the office. VII. Potential Events A. Potential Events and Activities for S 1. Private Dinner or Luncheon with the Governors and Urban Mayors; 2.

"C05766239"	"Sorry -- meant to send earlier: China sees no chance of climate deal - source Thu Dec 17, 2009 Print I Single Page By Krittivas Mukherjee and Pete Harrison COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - China has told participants in the U.N. climate change talks that it sees no possibility of achieving an operational accord this week, an official involved in the Copenhagen talks said on Thursday. Dozens of heads of state are descending on the Danish capital to address the December 7-18 conference, and had hoped to sign on Friday a new pact to tackle global warming. The official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters the Chinese had instead suggested issuing \"a short political declaration of some sort,\" but it was not clear what that would say. The official said negotiations were continuing to try to reach a breakthrough that would still allow an operational agreement to be signed. The official said the sticking point for China appeared to be a process issue. U.S. President Barack Obama has called for an \"operational accord\" -- essentially a political agreement with teeth that can get countries working to cut or curb their greenhouse gas emissions while a more formal and binding treaty is hammered out in 2010. Some ministers warned that slow, often stalled talks during the summit meant it was staring at failure. \"We may not get there on the substance, it is quite possible we'll fail on the substance, but at least let's give it a try,\" said Britain's energy and climate minister Ed Miliband. \"At the moment the problem is we're not giving it a try.\" Developed and developing nations are at odds over who should cut emissions, how deep the cuts should be, and how much funding should be provided to poor countries to help them shift to greener growth and adapt to a warmer world. While the overall picture is bleak, there has been some progress in areas critical to reaching a deal. Africa dramatically scaled back its expectations for climate aid from rich nations, and Japan pledged about $11 billion (6.8 billion pound) in public funds to 2012 to help poor countries adapt to a warmer world and cut their emissions. Talks on a U.N.-backed system to pay poorer nations to curb deforestation have advanced, and the United States pledged $1 billion in short-term funds to conserve tropical forests. A major sticking point between the world's top emitters, the United States and China, has been the question of how they will prove they are sticking to emission-curbing plans. On Tuesday, China's climate change ambassador warned developed countries against using climate change as an excuse to set up trade barriers. Yu Qingtai said rich nations should not think that slapping carbon tariffs on imports from countries with different emissions control regimes would substitute for reaching a global deal to tackle warming."

"C05766606"	"Here's the update, pieced together from various sources: Starting at around 3 pm Friday, Adams and McGuinness returned to Hillsborogh to meet with Robinson and Arlene Foster. The four talked privately for several hours and then asked for the draft papers to review. The discussion continued until around 1 am when the parties left Hillsborough. (Foster's presence is apparently very helpful. Her relationship with the SF leaders is much more positive and direct, treating them as equal colleagues.) Woodward and Irish FM Martin will meet with Adams and Robinson separately this afternoon to assess where the talks are. The talks last night/early morning ended more positively and if that is still the case there may be a decision to push on today to see if agreement can be reached. It is equally possible that the two ministers and DUP/SF will decide to wind up today and resume on Monday. Brown and Cowen have spoken this morning and will speak again late this afternoon. The issue is still parades. Robinson needs some certainity of change on parades. It is important for him politically within the DUP, but also externally since this has become a symbol of whether he has achieved something or compromised too much. Adams and SF have moved very far from their original positions on parades, adding that Robinson has also moved. The DUP linkage of the timeframes for devolution and parades is not Robinson's goal but DUP deputy party leader Nigal Dodds. Logistically, such a linkage would be impossible without delaying devolution given that the parades framework requires consultation, legislation, and implementation. The role of Justice Minister and his/her relationship to the Executive has been agreed. Other issues, such as Irish language act, N-S bodies, etc, while symbolic and emotive for SF and the nationalists community can be dealt with."

I'll continue to keep you posted as things move forward. The New Public Diplomacy Joseph S. Nye 2010-02-10 CAMBRIDGE — The world of traditional power politics was typically about whose military or economy would win. In today's information age, politics is also about whose \"story\" wins. National narratives are, indeed, a type of currency. Governments compete with each other and with other organizations to enhance their own credibility and weaken that of their opponents. Witness the contest between the government and protesters after the Iranian elections in June 2009, in which the Internet and Twitter played crucial roles, or the recent controversy between Google and China. Reputation has always mattered in world politics, but credibility has become crucial because of a \"paradox of plenty.\" When information is plentiful, the scarce resource is attention. Under the new conditions, a soft sell may, more than ever, prove more effective than a hard sell. For example, the relative independence of the BBC, sometimes a source of consternation to British governments, has paid rich dividends in credibility, as illustrated by this account of Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete's day: \"he rises at dawn, listens to the BBC World Service, then scans the Tanzanian press.\" Skeptics who treat the term \"public diplomacy\" as a mere euphemism for propaganda miss the point. Simple propaganda is counterproductive as public diplomacy. Nor is public diplomacy merely a public-relations campaign. Public diplomacy also involves building long-term relationships that create an enabling environment for government policies. The contribution of direct government information to long-term cultural relationships varies with three dimensions or stages of public diplomacy, and all three are important. The first and most immediate dimension is daily communications, which involves explaining the context of domestic and foreign-policy decisions. This dimension also involves preparation for dealing with crises. If there is a vacuum in information after an event, others will rush in to fill it. The second dimension is strategic communication, which develops a set of simple themes, much as a political or advertising campaign does. While the first dimension is measured in hours and days, the second occurs over weeks, months, and even years. The third dimension of public diplomacy is the development of lasting relationships with key individuals over many years or even decades, through scholarships, exchanges, training, seminars, conferences, and access to media channels. These programs develop what the American journalist Edward R. Murrow once called the crucial \"last three feet\" — face-to-face communications, with the enhanced credibility that reciprocity creates. But even the best advertising cannot sell an unpopular product. A communications strategy cannot work if it cuts against the grain of policy. Actions speak louder than words. All too often, policymakers treat public diplomacy as a bandage that can be applied after damage is done by other instruments. For example, China tried to enhance its soft power by successfully staging the 2008 Olympics, but its domestic simultaneous crackdown in Tibet — and subsequent repression in Xinxiang and arrests of human rights lawyers — undercut its gains. Great powers try to use culture and narrative to create soft power that promotes their advantage, but they do not always understand how to do it. Critics in the United States complain that the over-militarization of foreign policy undercuts its credibility. Instead, they advocate diplomacy \"on steroids,\" staffed by diplomats trained in new media, cross-cultural communications, granular local knowledge, and networks of contacts with under- represented groups. The centralized mass-media approach to public diplomacy still plays an important role. Governments need to correct daily misrepresentations of their policies, as well as to try to convey a longer-term strategic message. The main strength of the mass-media approach is its audience reach and ability to generate public awareness and set the agenda. But its weakness is its inability to influence how the message is perceived in different cultural settings. The sender knows what she says, but not always what the targets hear. Cultural barriers are apt to distort what is heard. Networked communications, on the other hand, can take advantage of two-way communications and peer-to- peer relations to overcome cultural differences. This type of decentralization and flexibility is difficult for governments to accomplish, given their central accountability structures. The greater flexibility of non-governmental organizations in using networks has given rise to what some call \"the new public diplomacy,\" which is no longer confined to messaging, promotion campaigns, or even direct governmental contacts with foreign publics serving foreign-policy purposes. It is also about building relationships with civil-society actors in other countries and facilitating networks between non-governmental parties at home and abroad. In this approach to public diplomacy, government policy is aimed at promoting and participating in, rather than controlling, such cross-border networks. Indeed, too much government control, or even the appearance of it, can undercut the credibility that such networks are designed to engender. The evolution of public diplomacy from one-way communications to a two-way dialogue treats publics as co-creators of meaning and communication. Power in a global information age, more than ever, will include a soft dimension of attraction as well as the hard dimensions of coercion and payment. Combining these dimensions effectively is called \"smart power.\" For - example, the current struggle against transnational terrorism is a struggle over winning hearts and minds, and over-reliance on hard power alone is not the path to success. Public diplomacy is an important tool in the arsenal of smart power, but smart public diplomacy requires an understanding of credibility, self-criticism, and the role of civil society in generating soft power. If it degenerates into propaganda, public diplomacy not only fails to convince, but can undercut soft power. Instead, it must remain a two-way process, because soft power depends, first and foremost, upon understanding the minds of others."

Gelb February 15, 2010 I 10:48pm I ....7IKristoffer Tripplaar / SPA President Obama desperately needs a sweeping staff shakeup to save his presidency. Leslie H. Gelb on why he must reassign Rahm, dump Larry Summers, and get rid of National Security adviser Jim Jones. The negative, even dismissive, talk about the Obama White House has reached a critical point. The president must change key personnel now. Unless he speedily sets up a new team, he will be reduced to a speechmaker. It's mostly a matter of relocating the Chicago and campaign crowd who surround the Oval Office and inserting people with proven records of getting things done in Washington and the world. To be fair, it's not clear whether the bad judgments on priorities, practicalities, and steadiness come from Mr. Obama or his White House team. Maybe he overpowers them in discussions, or maybe he gives them a role in policymaking far beyond their experience in that realm. Unless you're there, you don't know. But Mr. Obama is the president, and except for the right-wing crazies, most Americans still recognize his great talents and promise. It is he who's got to be helped. So it is they who've got to go. It is he who's got to be helped. So it is they who've got to go. One may quarrel with my sense of urgency here. But it's hard to have a conversation with opinion leaders anywhere—and especially in Washington—that doesn't descend into ripping Obama's White House team. The refrain of complaints is always the same: • Obama is forever taking strong stances only to backfill and trim. Most recently, he said he did not \"begrudge\" Wall Streeters their big earnings because that was part of the market system. This, in the face of his saying only a couple of weeks ago that such big bonuses were \"shameful.\" • Obama doesn't know what's really going on. Regarding the Middle East, he recently said that \"I think it is absolutely true that what we did this year didn't produce the kind of breakthrough that we wanted, and if we had anticipated some of these political problems on both sides earlier, we might not have raised expectations as high.\" He had to be totally out of it not to realize that the Palestinians and Israelis were nowhere close to sitting down with each other and dealing. • Obama wants to get along with everyone so badly he doesn't recognize real opposition when he sees it—let alone know how to deal with it. He emerges from a meeting with congressional Republican leaders on health-care reform and says he is \"an eternal optimist—when those very same Republican leaders just told the press that they don't see any common ground and believe the administration has to \"scrap the bill and start over.\" • It's even hard to follow his latest Afghan policy. He calls Afghanistan a \"war of necessity\" and orders more than 30,000 new troops there, coupled with an announcement that he'll begin withdrawing some of them in a year plus, only to see some of his advisers say he will start withdrawals and some say he won't. I've scribbled similar points in recent months in The Daily Beast. And last week in The Financial Times, Edward Luce provided a thunderclap on Washington's negative consensus about the incompetence of Obarna's Chicago-laden team. Luce named names in the White House, and a number of journalists and bloggers strikingly failed to link to the Luce story. They were said to fear the wrath of the Chicagoans. Steve Clemons, author of The Washington Note, essentially eridorse.d the Luce finding and slapped his fellow bloggers' wrists for hiding from this issue. The situation is as serious as it was during the Carter administration. There, two very capable political campaigners--Hamilton Jordan and Jody Powell—moved into critical White House positions without knowing very much about doing business in Washington. And they were, quite naturally, too busy to learn. They also added to the \"them\" versus \"us\" (Washington insiders and bureaucrats versus the regular guys from Georgia) mentality that plagues most administrations. The Chicagoans and others \"guarding\" the president create their own \"us versus them\" world. It's hard to imagine a policy conversation between the president and the Chicago crowd, since none of them, except Rahm Emanuel, has Washington or policy experience. And there isn't much evidence that they bring in strong-minded outsiders to challenge the president on a regular basis either. The result is an inexperienced president advised by an inexperienced team. Here are the personnel changes being bruited about in political and policy circles: First, remove Rahm Emanuel as chief of staff and move him to a senior political adviser slot. No one I've talked to believes he has the management skills and discipline to run the White House. But he is a terrific political mind and a fighter and should be given the new job and the time to do his thing. Proven pros who could step right in include the following: Erskine Bowles, president of the University of North Carolina and former Clinton chief of staff; Leon Panetta, now CIA director and formerly White House chief as well under Clinton; Sylvia Mathews, a former deputy chief of staff also under Clinton; and John Podesta, another former Clinton chief who now heads the Center for American Progress. All four are tough and know how to manage. Replace Lawrence Summers, director of the White House's National Economic Council, with Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve. Summers is brilliant and highly controversial; he's been beaten up and is said to want out anyway. Volcker has unmatched stature, practical experience, and the courage of a lion. He is the only one now in a position to get down to step-by-step brass tacks on the economy and stop Mr. Obama's weekly gyrations. Others with proven track records who can help as inside or outside advisers are: Stephen Robert, formerly head of Oppenheimer, Vincent Mai, former leader of AEA Investors, and Tom Hill of Blackstone. There are also two economic stars in Washington who'd improve both policymaking and public combat: Sheila Bair, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Elizabeth Warren, chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel. One outside adviser above all would help the president see the economic hard choices ahead: Peter G. Peterson, accomplished businessman and policy head. David Axelrod, the senior political adviser to the president, needs to concentrate on the next presidential campaign, wherein his expertise lies, and not on domestic and foreign policy, where he is just another smart unknowledgeable voice. Good replacements who do know the politics of Washington would be the aforementioned Podesta; and Tom Deschle, the former Democratic Senate Majority Leader. As for David Plouffe, another senior campaign aide, now in unofficial residence at the White House, he should be lodged in the nearby Executive Office Building. Senior adviser and Chicago buddy Valerie Jarrett is too much a part of the inner circle to move, but she should be given a more limited role in making policy. Mr. Obama's crowd appears to think that getting things done means his giving another speech. It's nice, but not nearly enough. Robert Gibbs needs a rest from being press secretary. Let's put it this way: He wasn't born for daily jousts with pithy Republicans. His job calls for memorable and pointed phrases and attacks, not circle-the-wagon circumlocutions. Possible successors? Try Doyle McManus of the L.A. Times, Jake Tapper of ABC News, or Helene Cooper of The New York Times. Last but not least, James Jones, the National Security Adviser, has to move on. The career Marine was greatly admired and respected as Commandant of the Corps and as NATO's military chief. He handled those duties with great skill. But by wide acclamation inside and outside the White House, he has not emerged as a strategist—perhaps the key requirement of this key position. The person in that job has to pull everything together—laying out achievable objectives and precise plans to dispense carefully packaged carrots and sticks. One Democrat who could step in now, despite his age, is Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's national-security adviser. He has a first-rate strategic mind—a rare quality—and knows how to deliver results. Obama will need to iron out Zbig's lack of sympathy toward Israel and Russia. Also available are a boatload of first-class retired diplomats with the judgment and background needed to perform the National Security Council job effectively. They would be greeted with applause both at home and abroad. Try former ambassadors Thomas Pickering, Morton Abramowitz, Frank Wisner, Reginald Bartholomew, and Winston Lord. They have it all. At a minimum, they and others like them should form the core of a group that meets regularly with Obama on strategy. Yes, many of the pros suggested above have reached their golden years. But 70 and even 80 are the new 60. They all possess the necessary energy, experience and rare skill in delivering results. They are also shovel-ready. As a critical bonus, they could and would mentor the next generation down, a very talented one indeed, to succeed them in two or three years. To lead America and the world, Obama has to grow far beyond his present propensity to treat problems as intellectual puzzles—to collect facts and hear the arguments. The great tasks of governing demand proven intuition in sensing what's achievable, which buttons to push when, how to buy the time for power to take hold, how to make adjustments without flagrantly foolish rhetoric, how to avoid failures that only diminish power, and how to succeed in small as well as large ways. With a team versed in such arts and skills, President Obama and America would succeed. Leslie H. Gelb, a former New York Times columnist and senior government official, is author of powerRule,5-.

Sid Tony lair's bid for EU residency sinks Ex-PM's chances of winning role slide as Sarkozy and Merkel fail to back him • Nicholas s‘tv'at.i. and )an,..Trajf.pf in Brussels • u!,-„ Thursday 29 October 2009 21.26 GMT T20.,.:31::.3.1:7's hopes of becoming Europe's first sitting president were receding fast tonight as Britain admitted his chances of success were \"fading\" after the continent's centre-right leaders made it clear one of their own must have the post. Hours after G .nr.4, ,efl Srov.,,h delivered his strongest statement of support for Blair — disclosing that he had spoken to him earl;er this week — British sources indicated that the former prime minister was unlikely to assume the high-profile. job. \"it would be right to describe Tony's c,hances as fading,\" one British source said.\"..slcgles. t. ..aa'r.sa; and are not terribly enthusiastic. Silvio Berlust.-,oni remains his strongest backer.\" Bialr's expected failure to secure the post of president of the European Council meant that ca,•,-,'et., ..\"it;ity.n-te was emerging as a serious contender to assume the new post of high representative for foreign policy. The foreign secretary insisted, however, that.he was \"not available\". Miliband spoke out as British sources said it had become clear in recent days that Blair would struggle to become president. The post is likely to be filled in the next month amid signs that the Czech Republic will become the last EU country to ratify the Lisbon treaty. Sarkozy, the French president, and Merkel, the German chancellor, are understood to have agreed at a dinner at the Elysee Palace last night that the new president should be appointed from the main centre-right EPP grouping, which brings together the parties currently ruling most EU countries. Brown gave a hint at a press conference that Blair's candidacy was fading when he qualified his strong backing for his predecessor by stating that there were also other candidates for the job. \"Of course it may not happen and there are other candidates as well,\" he said. The prime minister's remarks came after he attended an acrimonious meeting of the European centre-left leaders this afternoon, shortly before the EU summit in Brussels began. Brown was understood to have had a tense exchange with Martin Schulz, the German leader of the Socialists in the European parliament, who wants the left to assume the new foreign policy post, leaving the presidency to the centre right. Brown told the meeting: \"You need to get real. This is a unique opportunity to get a progressive politician to be the president of the council.\" But it soon became clear that Blair has no support on the left, let alone on the centre right. Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's centre-left prime minister, for the first time publicly queried the Blair candidacy by announcing that the centre left across the EU was more concerned with securing the other post of European foreign minister. Zapatero, who will have to work with the new European figureheads when Spain assumes the Eti's six-month rotating presidency on 1 January, said the European socialists were clear that they want the post of the high representative. \"There is a preference for the high representative,\" he said. \"That is rather reasonable.\" A senior Spanish official said this was the first time that Zapatero had \"dropped Blair\" and that the centre-left in the EU was seeking a deal with the centre-right, led by Merkel. The centre-right would get the job coveted by Blair, while the centre left would take the foreign minister post. The lack of support for Blair became clear when Jean Asselborn, Luxembourg's foreign minister, launched a strong attack on him as be emerged from the meeting of Socialist leaders. \"lt is not about the person of Tony Blair. Now in the United States, Obama is the president, it is no more Mr Bush. We have a new treaty, we have to reset Europe and we need to start with some new ideas. There is and will remain a link for the next generation between Iraq, Bush and Tony Blair.\" Downing Street wiil resist criticism that it was wrong to mount such a strong campaign in favour of Blair when it had become clear earlier this week that his chances were fading. Brown believes it was right — and in the national interest — to argue strongly for Blair when there was a chance to secure such a senior post for Britain. Blair, who had a tense relationship with Brown during his decade as prime minister, will be pleased by the strength of his successor's support. Brown said today: \"Let me say very clear that we, the British government, believe that Tony Blair would be an excellent candidate and an excellent person to hold the job of president of the council. \"His international experience is well known, his expertise on environmental, economic and security issues is well known to everybody throughout Europe as well as known throughout the world If you have the chance for that to happen it is in Britain's national interest.\" guardian.co.uk Guardian News and Media Limited 2009"

She was 46. \"It is with profound sadness and shock that I announce the passing of Paula Nowakowski, my longtime chief of staff, trusted aide and friend, who died suddenly last night,\" Boehner said in a statement early Sunday afternoon. \"Words cannot adequately express the sorrow and disbelief I and every member of our team are grappling with today in the wake of this stunning news.\" A Boehner aide said the cause was an apparent heart attack. President Barack Obama and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) were among those who called Boehner Sunday to offer their condolences on Nowakoski's death. \"The entire Capitol Hill community is shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of Paula Nowakowski,\" Pelosi said in a statement. \"As Chief of Staff to Republican Leader John Boehner, Paula earned the respect not only of her Leadership and Conference, but all House Members on both sides of the aisle. She served Leader Boehner both in his current position as well as previously at the Committee on Education and the Workforce with great distinction. \"Paula was a thorough professional who loved the House and worked in a constructive and bipartisan fashion to implement policies to help the Congress function efficiently. On behalf of the entire House, I express our deep sadness to Paula's family, friends and our colleague, Leader John Boehner.\" \"Paula had some of the finest qualities a public servant can have: she was committed to advancing the cause of freedom, she cared deeply about the people she served, and she was a patriot,\" said Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY.). \"On behalf of her senate colleagues, I pass on my condolences to her family, Leader Boehner and his staff, and the whole House family for this tragic loss of our friend.\" It would be hard to overstate Nowakowski's role in Boehner's tight-knit office. She has worked for the Ohio Republican almost continuously since 1995, when she joined his staff as communications director for the Republican Conference. In the years since, she has worked as staff director for the Education and Labor Committee and served as his chief of staff since he returned to the leadership in early 2006. She briefly left Boehner's side in 1998 after he lost the conference post following a tough election for Republicans but rejoined him in 2001 when he assumed the chairmanship of the Education and Labor Committee. Along the way, she counseled Boehner on just about every decision he made and often served as an enforcer of sorts for the collegial Republican leader. It would be hard to find any chief of staff on Capitol Hill who maintained a closer relationship with her boss than the one she shared with Boehner. Aides said Sunday that Boehner's office and extended network of former colleagues, known to many as \"Boehner-land,\" were collectively shocked by the news. \"We will remember Paula as she would want to be remembered — as a tireless worker, faithful friend, rabid Detroit sports fan, whip-smart strategist, warrior for freedom and devoted Catholic who counted President Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II among her greatest heroes. She will never be replaced or forgotten,\" Boehner said. \"I ask for your prayers for Paula's family.\" ©2009Capitol News Company, LLC FD HIDDEN DIV Tmt Washington ost NEWS! POLITICS I OPINIONS!

Boehner, was found dead Jan. 10 at her home in Alexandria. No official cause of death was available. Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for Boehner (R-Ohio), said it appeared that Ms. Nowakowski died of a heart attack. A longtime Hill aide, and Boehner's staff chief since 2006, Ms. Nowakowski was named by the Capitol Hill publication Roll Call to its 2009 list of the \"Fabulous Fifty\" staff members. The accolade recognized her savvy, her clout and her access to the top people in Congress. Ms. Nowakowski, an avowed conservative, was highly regarded by leaders of both parties. She was praised by Boehner and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). \"It is with profound sadness and shock that I announce the passing of Paula Nowakowski, my longtime chief of staff, trusted aide, and friend, who died suddenly,\" Boehner said in a statement. \"Words cannot adequately express the sorrow and disbelief I and every member of our team are grappling with today in the wake of this stunning news,\" Boehner said. Pelosi called Ms. Nowakowski a \"thorough professional who loved the House and worked in a constructive and bipartisan fashion to implement policies to help the Congress function efficiently.\" According to WhoRunsGov. corn, a Washington Post Co. Web site, Ms. Nowakowski grew up in St. Clair Shores, Mich., and studied English at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. She told Politico of being made more conservative by the campus \"rise of the loony left,\" citing \"wacky, wacky stuff,\" which shaped her politics. According to a reference book on congressional aides, she worked for the Republican National Committee in the late 1980s and early 1990s, then joined the staff of the House Republican Conference. After two years as a public affairs vice president of the American Insurance Association, she worked from 2001 to 2006 as staff director of the House Committee on Education & the Workforce. A Boehner aide said she worked for him at both the Republican Conference and the Education Committee. Pelosi's staff chief, John Lawrence, who was Ms. Nowakowski's Democratic counterpart on the education committee, said they transcended political differences to \"work in a very collegial way to strengthen the House itself.\" He called her \"a great professional.\" After the GOP lost its House majority in 2006 , Ms. Nowakowski said she experienced \"the seven stages of grief,\" according to the Almanac of the Unelected 2008, a reference on Hill staffers. \"You don't want to be a compliant minority,\" she said of the party's new status, \"but you have to adjust your expectations.\" In his statement, Boehner called Ms. Nowakowski \"a tireless worker, faithful friend and rabid Detroit sports fan.

Sid March 5, 2010 New blow for Tories as lead slips in marginals By Nigel Morris and Michael Savage Poll shows crumbling support in target seats as David Cameron is drawn into Ashcroft non-dom row The Conservative lead is crumbling in the crucial marginal seats that David Cameron is relying on to deliver general election victory for the party, a poll last night disclosed. The result was a fresh setback for the Tory leader after a torrid day in which he was drawn deeper into the row over the billionaire peer Lord Ashcroft, when it emerged that he had known for less than a month that Lord Ashcroft had maintained his non-dom tax status for 10 years. The chances of the party drawing a line under the controversy were also wrecked by the announcement that Lord Ashcroft will be summoned to the Commons to explain why he negotiated a secret deal to enter the House of Lords without paying tax in this country on his overseas fortune. With Gordon Brown expected to announce the election date this month, senior Tories have put a brave face on their sliding support in national opinion polls since the turn of the year. They insisted they were performing much more strongly in marginal constituencies where the drive for votes has been masterminded and substantially funded by Lord Ashcroft. The YouGov poll for Channel 4 News found the Tory lead in 60 Labour-held marginals had shrunk from seven to just two points over the past year. The slide in Conservative support is further evidence Britain could be heading for a hung parliament after the election expected on 6 May. The survey put the Tories on 39 per cent (down four points since last year) and Labour on 37 per cent (up one). YouGov calculated that the results would leave the Tories the largest party after the election, but 11 seats short of an overall Commons majority. An investigation by The Independent last week found the Tories spent £6m over two years in the marginal battlegrounds, in most cases far outspending Labour and the Liberal Democrats. The party faces the daunting challenge of capturing 117 seats to achieve a majority of just one - a task described by a shadow cabinet member as a \"mountain to climb\". The Conservatives received some good news yesterday when an 18-month inquiry by the Electoral Commission concluded that the £5.1m they received in donations from Bearwood Corporate Services, controlled by Lord Ashcroft, were legal. The party would have faced having to pay the money back had the electoral watchdog reached the opposite conclusion. However, the commission added its regret that the Tories refused to agree to interviews and that Lord Ashcroft had destroyed documents relating to the ownership of the company."

Not bad. http: I /www.economist.com/world/international/displavstorv.cfm?story id=15833005 Religion and human rights The limits of freedom and faith Mar 31st 2010 From The Economist print edition Opponents of a bid by Muslim states to \"protect religion\" claim a small success How dare you call us blasphemers? IT DOES not happen often: Christian lobbyists, the sort who favour prayer in American classrooms and crucifixes in Italian ones, lining up on the same side as secularists who battle to curb religion's role in the public square. But in both those camps there has been some quiet satisfaction after a recent vote at the United Nations. Not over the outcome, but over the slim margin of defeat. On March 25th the Human Rights Council (HRC), a Geneva-based UN agency which often exasperates its Western members, voted by 20 votes to 17, with eight abstentions, for a text that lists the \"defamation of religion\" as an infringement of liberty. Nothing amazing there: the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), which groups 56 mainly Muslim states (plus Palestine), has been working to push resolutions of that kind through the General Assembly and other UN bodies since 2005. But the margin was the smallest ever, and opponents think there could be a good chance of defeating a \"defamation\" motion next time one comes around. The OIC's idea is to establish the principle that faiths need protection, just as individuals do. It denies any sinister intention (see article). And to some ears, the OIC's effort sounds like harmless UN-speak, but nothing more. (The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, a congressionally mandated body, has noted a logical flaw: defamation means harming the reputation of a living person or entity: that implies that one can't defame an idea or a religious founder who is no longer, at least physically, alive on earth.) But critics of the OIC campaign, who include atheists, Christians and indeed some Muslims, say the \"defamation\" idea is worse than hot air: far from protecting human rights, it emboldens countries that use blasphemy laws to criminalise dissent. What encourages these critics is that more countries seem to be coming around to their view. Mexico, Uruguay, Argentina, Zambia and South Korea voted against the latest resolution. Brazil criticised the text but abstained. Deeper still inside the UN's bureaucracy, another battle over religion rages—and the stakes could be even higher. An \"ad hoc committee\" is mulling ways to amend or extend the UN convention on racial discrimination. Certain states want language that would fuse the categories of race and faith; some want a new convention, or a protocol to the existing one. For secularists (in the broad sense of people, including believers, who oppose the idea of faith having privileged access to power), all this is alarming. Non-binding resolutions against defamation are bad enough; a UN treaty on race-plus-religion would have legal force, at least for its signatories, and give heart to theocrats. At the HRC's latest discussion of this effort in March, the Algerian who oversees the project was keen to plough ahead. But countries like Switzerland, Japan, Mexico, Argentina and France retorted that it would be better to enforce the existing UN norms than dream up new ones. Efforts to widen the racism accord will resume, with a new chairman, late this year—but critics are relieved to have stalled it. Still, would-be theocrats may now focus harder on adding to the racism charter, because they face a real risk of being defeated over defamation, in the view of Roy Brown, Geneva spokesman for the International Humanist and Ethical Union. Meanwhile a Christian-inspired NGO, the European Centre for Law and Justice, has been denouncing the abuse of blasphemy laws in many OIC member states. How fair is their point? It is an easy case to make, for example, over Pakistan. Some 41 complaints of blasphemy were registered by police in Pakistan last year, says that country's independent Human Rights Commission. In theory, blasphemy is punishable by death—a penalty that has been handed down but never carried out. Worst-hit by the law are minorities like Christians and Ahmadis, a group whose claim to be Muslim is rejected by the Pakistani state. Although abuse of the law is less rife now than in the 1980s, when an Islamist general tightened up the rules, the law is still invoked in disputes (over property, say) that have nothing to do with faith. \"The most vulnerable people, that is religious minorities, continue to be charged with blasphemy,\" said Ali Dayan Hasan, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, a campaign group. \"But are people convicted? No. Rarely. It is used as an instrument of political and social coercion.\" When convictions occur, they lead to long jail terms; and pre-trial detention can last for years. Pakistan's parliament is revising the constitution but it has left intact the religious bits, despite a vow by the ruling party to review the blasphemy laws. (Indonesia too has stepped back from a move to liberalise its blasphemy regime.) On Pakistani streets, the law has dire effects. In January 2009, in a village in Punjab province, five Ahmadis, a labourer and four children, were charged with blasphemy. They had supposedly written \"Prophet Muhammad\" on the wall of a mosque toilet. The children were behind bars for nearly six months till the charge was quashed. And last September a young Pakistani Christian was accused of throwing part of the Koran down a drain. It seems that his real crime, however, was affection for a Muslim woman. A mob torched a church, and many Christians had to flee. He was taken to jail, where he died a few days later. His family alleged torture; the authorities claimed suicide. There was mayhem at the funeral and the country's Christians (see picture) were appalled. In some places, it is not the \"defamation\" of faith that threatens rights but measures that supposedly defend it."

Sid Labour c.uIi win most seats at eneral election, poll shows Guardian/ICM poll reveals gap between two main parties at four points — the closest in an ICM poll for almost two years • Julian Glover • aardian.co.uk, Monday 5 April 2010 19.02 BST • Article history Lbr still has a fighting chance of winning the most seats in the general election, according to a Guardian/1CM poll published today. The findings suggest Tory hopes of a defining breakthrough have been overplayed, with the gap between the two main parties now at just four points — the closest in an 1CM poll for almost two years. Labour support has climbed four points to 33% since an ICM poll carried out for the Guardian last week. Conservative backing has dropped one since then to 37% — Labour's best ICM rating since December 2008 and the Tories' worst since February. On a uniform national swing, these figures could leave Labour 30 seats short of an overall majority. Even if the Tories perform better than average in marginal seats — as most people expect — David Cameron would struggle to establish a secure parliamentary basis for power. Either party could be left dependent on the fiber:a) Democrats, who are on 21% in the poll — down two from last week. Despite that decline, the Lib Dems will be pleased by the strength of their position going into the election. The party has been at or above 20% in seven of this year's 11 ICM polls. Meanwhile support for other parties, which peaked last spring in the European elections, has fallen again to just 9%. At the start of an election campaign likely to see more polling than ever before in British politics, today's figures will be treated with caution unless confirmed by other surveys. Some polls late last week suggested the Conservative lead had grown rather than shrunk, and research may have been affected by the Easter holidays, when some voters would have been away from home. Yet the results suggest that Labour's chances should not be written off, and events such as the leaders' debates could prove decisive in the coming weeks. Today's poll suggests 60% of people are planning to watch at least one debate, with 29% saying they plan to watch all three. Only 39% of voters said they would not watch any of them. The ICM survey also asked voters whether they might switch away from their first choice party and, if so;who they might back instead. Labour and Tory support is now equally solid. Overall, 71% of Labour supporters say they will definitely back Labour while 71% of Tories also say they will stick with their first choice party. Lib Dems, however, are less loyal — only 52% are sure they will end up giving Nick Clegg their vote. That leaves just over a quarter of each main party's supporters considering backing another party. The proportion of Lib Dems and ConservatIves. saying they might vote Labour instead has doubled since ICM last asked this question earlier in the year. The ICM figures suggest the maximum potential vote for Labour and the Conservatives — all their definite supporters, plus all potential switchers — is running neck and neck at 42%. The Lib Dem maximum is 28%. Realistically, Labour is unlikely to beat its 2005 share of 36% and even today's poll suggesting it has shed only three points since then will surprise many. Nonetheless, there is all to play for as the contest begins now. •ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1,001 adults aged 18 and over by telephone on 1-3 April 2010.

Sid • Print this page From Times Online April 14, 2010 Tory lead narrows amid huge voter disenchantment, Times poll finds olmage :1 of 20, Peter Riddell The general election race is tightening, according to a Populus poll for The Times that reveals deep public disenchantment with the campaign so far. The poll, undertaken yesterday and this morning, says that more voters are now hoping for a hung parliament than either a Tory or a Labour outright victory. Conservative support has slipped by three points over the past week to 36 per cent, while Labour is a point up at 33 per cent. The Liberal Democrats are unchanged on 21 per cent. The polls tend to fluctuate by a couple of points either way. and these shifts are within the margin of error of the average. With other new polls pointing to a firming in Labour support, the party may have enjoyed a small boost from its manifesto launch. Tory strategists will hope to have achieved a boost from its manifesto launch today. If the Populus figures were repeated in the general election in three weeks' time, and there is a uniform switch in votes, Labour would be the largest single party, with about 300 MPs, ahead of the Tories on 264 and the Lib Dems on 54. This would point to a Lab/Lib Dem coalition. But many analysts do not expect a uniform national swing. The latest poll shows that 32 per cent of the public now hope for a hung parliament (as opposed to expecting one), against 28 per cent wanting a Tory majority and 22 per cent a Labour one. Lib Dem voters prefer a deal with Labour than the Tories in a hung parliament, by 44 to 31 per cent. The public is evenly split 40 to 42 per cent about whether they want Labour or the Tories in either a majority or a minority government. The poll shows that the number expecting a Tory overall majority has risen by three points to 34 per cent over the past week. This only just exceeds the number expecting a hung parliament, at 33 per cent, down six points compared with a week ago. Overall, 57 per cent expect the Tories to be the largest party, against 29 per cent expecting Labour to be. The public is deeply sceptical about the honesty of the parties. Only 4 per cent think that they are being completely honest about their tax plans, 61 per cent partly honest. Only 6 per cent say they are being completely honest about cutting the deficit and 61 per cent partly honest. Some 7 per cent say that they are being completely honest about the extent to which they can fund their policies by cutting waste and 58 per cent partly honest. Voters were asked to say which party had proposed eight key manifesto pledges. They wrongly identified four: reducing the increase in national insurance contributions (naming Labour not the Tories); allowing unsuccessful schools, hospitals and the police (the Tories, not Labour); tightening up takeover rules (the Tories not Labour); and requiring foreign workers employed in public services to speak fluent English (the Tories not Labour). In only one case, the £150-a-year tax break, did more than half of voters (60 per cent) correctly identify the party making the proposal. In most cases, the pledge will make little difference to people's votes, apart from three made by Labour: the foreign workers language pledge, doubling paid paternity leave and allowing the takover of unsuccessful schools, hospitals etc. More than two fifths (43 per cent), including 50 per cent of women, say \"none of the parties\", or \"don't know\", when asked which party is putting across a convincing cases to voters. This compares with 25 per cent naming the Tories and 18 per cent Labour. Just over half the public (54 per cent) plan to watch the first televised leaders' debate on Thursday evening. Men and middle class professionals are more likely to say that they will view. More than two fifths (42 per cent) expect David Cameron to win the debate, against 22 per cent for Gordon Brown. More Tories (70 per cent) than Labour voters ( 57 per cent) expect their leader to win. Two fifths of the public (42 per cent, up one point on a week ago) say it seems like a change from Labour, but are not sure that it is time for a change to the Conservatives. Some 33 per cent, down one point, think it is time for a change to the Tories. Populus interviewed a random sample of 1,525 adult voters on April 12 to 13.

I'd like us to consider a major speech on global health — the third in a trilogy. Linking these three issues thematically, we can explain how and why foreign policy challenges and solutions must be seen through a prism of human survival and why the conditions of people's lives influence everything from economic development to political stability and more. This trilogy of speeches (with the right PR) could further underscore our elevation of development AND our comprehensive, smart power approach to foreign policy. After all, food, water, and health are the sine qua non of human progress. And this is a Hillary Clinton signature idea, at least to me. Thoughts? LM"

"C05769116"	"Below is the final text of the Quartet statement, which Lavrov, Ban, and Ashton have now agreed to release *without a call.* Sounds like your discussion with Lavrov did the trick: The Quartet re-affirms that the current situation in Gaza, including the humanitarian and human rights situation of the civilian population, is unsustainable, unacceptable, and not in the interests of any of those concerned. The Quartet reiterates its call for a solution that addresses Israel's legitimate security concerns, including an end to weapons smuggling into Gaza; promotes Palestinian unity based on the Palestine Liberation Organization commitments and the reunification of Gaza and the West Bank under the legitimate Palestinian Authority; and ensures the unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons to and from Gaza, consistent with United Nations Security Council resolution 1860 (2009). The Quartet declares its readiness to work closely with Israel, the Palestinian Government and international donors in order to achieve sustainable economic development on the basis of the full implementation of the Agreement on Access and Movement of 2005 and in the broader perspective of the two-state solution. Consistent with these objectives, the Quartet and the Quartet Representative have worked with Israel, as well as consulting the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, and other concerned parties, to effect a fundamental change in policy in Gaza. The new policy towards Gaza just announced by the Government of Israel is a welcome development. The Quartet notes that the elaboration of further details and modalities of implementation will be important in ensuring the effectiveness of the new policy. Full and effective implementation will comprise a significant shift in strategy towards meeting the needs of Gaza's population for humanitarian and commercial goods, civilian reconstruction and infrastructure, and legitimate economic activity as well as the security needs of Israel. The Quartet will continue to work with Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and other concerned parties to ensure these arrangements are implemented as quickly as possible. The Quartet affirms that much work remains to achieve fully the solution stated above, and, in consultation with the concerned parties, it will monitor closely the implementation of the policy in all its aspects. It will actively explore additional ways to improve the situation in Gaza, encourage involvement of the PA at the crossings and promote greater commerce between the West Bank and Gaza. The Quartet stresses the importance of United Nations and other international interventions, as well as the work of local non-governmental organizations, to be expanded in Gaza to meet urgent civilian needs, and calls on all parties to fully enable this work. The Quartet recognizes that Israel has legitimate security concerns that must continue to be safeguarded, and believes efforts to maintain security while enabling movement and access for Palestinian people and goods are critical. The Quartet commits to work with Israel and the international community to prevent the illicit trafficking of arms and ammunition into Gaza. It urges all those wishing to deliver goods to do so through established channels so that their cargo can be inspected and transferred via land crossings into Gaza. The Quartet emphasizes that there is no need for unnecessary confrontations and calls on all parties to act responsibly in meeting the needs of the people of Gaza. The Quartet also calls for an end to the deplorable detention of Gilad Shalit in advance of the fourth anniversary of his capture on June 25; it further condemns the violation of Hamas' international obligation to provide him access by the International Committee of the Red Cross and demands that Hamas immediately remedy the situation. The Quartet also reiterates its support for proximity talks toward the resumption, without pre-conditions, of direct bilateral negotiations that resolve all final status issues as previously agreed by the parties. The Quartet believes these negotiations should lead to a settlement, negotiated between the parties within 24 months, that ends the occupation which began in 1967 and results in the emergence of an independent, democratic, and viable Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours."

"C05769591"	"SECURITY COUNCIL PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT ON THE RECENT INCIDENT IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN The Security Council deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries resulting from the use of force during the Israeli military operation in international waters against the convoy sailing to Gaza. The Council, in this context, condemns those acts which resulted in the loss of at least ten civilians and many wounded, and expresses its condolences to their families. The Security Council requests the immediate release of the ships as well as the civilians held by Israel. The Council urges Israel to permit full consular access, to allow the countries concerned to retrieve their deceased and wounded immediately, and to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance from the convoy to its destination. The Security Council takes note of the statement of the UN Secretary—General on the need to have a full investigation into the matter and it calls for a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforming to international standards. The Security Council stresses that the situation in Gaza is not sustainable. The Council re-emphasizes the importance of the full implementation of Resolutions 1850 and 1860. In that context, it reiterates its grave concern at the humanitarian situation in Gaza and stresses the need for sustained and regular flow of goods and people to Gaza as well as unimpeded provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza. The Security Council underscores that the only viable solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an agreement negotiated between the parties and re-emphasizes that only a two-State solution, with an independent and viable Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours, could bring peace to the region. The Security Council expresses support for the proximity talks and voices concern that this incident took place while the proximity talks are underway and urges the parties to act with restraint, avoiding any unilateral and provocative actions, and all international partners to promote an atmosphere of cooperation between the parties and throughout the region."
"C05769611"	"Madam Secretary, In advance of your meeting tomorrow with George Soros, below is some information in response to the letter you received from Soros proposing increased USG support for the American University of Central Asia (AUCA). SCA favors providing more USG support for AUCA Since 9/11 the United States has provided more than $15 million to AUCA in support of its endowment and various other initiatives. For a majority of these contributions the Soros Foundation matched one dollar for every two dollars provided by the USG. The major USG contributions to AUCA were two grants to the university endowment, the first in 2003 for $10 million, the second in 2008 for $3 million. Other USG support for AUCA included funding for two advisors to the AUCA president on accreditation and development, support for the journalism faculty, and scholarship funds for students from Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan to attend the university. Soros has proposed that the USG increase this support, offering a 1-1 match of $10 million each from State and his foundation, totaling $20 million over the next five years. Last fall SCA received the same proposal from Soros, and they have been discussing the issue with Soros' staff. A little bit of additional information from SCA on AUCA: The university has made significant progress this year on a number of its key objectives and remains a unique institution in Central Asia, a place where students are judged solely on merit and a forum for free expression and critical thinking. The university achieved an important milestone this year related to its U.S. accreditation, signing an agreement with Bard College under which AUCA graduates starting next May will receive full diplomas from Bard College, an institution accredited in the United States. In addition, AUCA recently established a new partnership with the American University in Kabul facilitated through state of the art video classroom technology and recently announced the appointment of Andrew Wachtel, from Northwestern University, as the new AUCA president who will take office this summer. I will include this note (in addition to Soros' letter) in your materials for your meeting with Soros tomorrow. Please let me know if you would like any further information. Thanks, Mike Michael H.

"C05769624"	"Gaza: it's Hamas's move now Hamas must seize the initiative if there is ever to be an end to Israel's occupation of Palestine • • c) Jeremy Greenstock o quardian.co.uk, Wednesday 2 June 2010 12.29 BST So it has happened again. Nearly 18 months after the Israelis bombed Gaza to a wasteland, with barely a load of building materials allowed in since then, Turkey has taken the brunt of an operation of humanitarian assistance gone wrong. The UN must establish the facts impartially and independently and, if laws have been broken, those responsible must be held to account. Political demonstrations posing as relief flotillas go wrong too easily and Israel understandably has to prevent weapons being smuggled into Gaza. But was this really the best way to bring the ships to shore for examination? A commando attack on civilian ships looks callous and disproportionate. No one should have been hurt, whatever the emotions behind all this. Why is Gaza under siege in the first place? Under international law, the Israelis are responsible as the occupying force for the proper administration of the territory; and half the point of Israel is not to be above the law. Yet they are creating a traumatised territory of 1.5m neighbours, many of whose children seem to want to grow up to be suicide bombers. They are also pouring fertiliser on al-Qaida's ground. The director of UNRWA operations in Gaza, John Ging, gave a speech in London this week entitled \"Illegal, inhuman. and insane: a medieval siege on Gaza in 2010\". This objective humanitarian practitioner should be listened to. How has Israel, the only democracy in its region and a symbol of the need for racially inspired violence to end, come to risk any claim to international legitimacy in its handling of this situation? Hamas are the enemy of Israel, but they do not have to be. They preach violent resistance too readily, yet over the past 17 months they have been trying to control the militant groups intent on threatening Israel with rockets — imperfectly perhaps, but not a single Israeli citizen has been killed (alas, one immigrant worker was) by a rocket since the Gaza bombing stopped in January 2009. They are also the implacable opponents of al-Qaida. They won a fair election in 2006 and claim to respect democracy. Let's test them on that. At present, Hamas security people are being sniped at by the Israeli Defence Forces when they try to arrest other militant groups. This is genuinely getting insane. The unwisdom of reliance on angry military responses is all the clearer when the mood in Palestine, in both the West Bank and Gaza, is steadily moving towards a negotiated end to the occupation. I am convinced from my own direct experience that Hamas is prepared to establish and respect a long-term ceasefire so that the talking can start without the threat of violence, and that they would enter in good faith, if that were reciprocated, into negotiations to establish two states in the disputed territories, Israel and Palestine, with their own rights and responsibilities under international law. The distortion of their position, a little of it the fault of their own PR, does no side any good. If a comprehensive negotiation is too much to expect for now, what about a first step? I believe an arrangement to end the blockade is within reach if only Israel, Egypt and Gaza would test the possibilities of dialogue. Hamas have indicated that they could cease all attacks on Israeli soil, close the tunnels, release Gilead Shalit and stop the import of arms into Gaza if the blockade was ended, an agreed number of Palestinian prisoners were released and Gaza began to be rebuilt. The Palestinians of course have work to do on their own internal reconciliation, while the relationship between Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza remains so bad. But the UN, the US, Russia, the EU and the Arab world must make a much more serious attempt to test the possibilities, putting ordinary Israelis and Palestinians first, not their own political comfort. We are coming close to losing the chance of a two-state solution. US policy, based on a West-Bank-only approach, is locked in a cul-de-sac if Gaza is left out of the equation, because majority Palestinian support will be lacking. Israel is confident in the knowledge that it cannot be militarily defeated. But that ignores the huge danger of losing the political, diplomatic, legal and moral high ground. This matters in today's world, as the US and the UK discovered in Iraq, because government authority and public opinion interact closely, and legitimacy breeds support. Israel's relationship with Turkey was the key to a broader understanding with the Islamic community and others beyond the west. That now lies in tatters. If Israel is left as the permanent occupier, or controlling a one-state structure with part of its population downgraded or imprisoned, it will truly be a disaster for its people and what they stand for. I hope that Hamas will not sit back and enjoy Israel's discomfiture. They have so far, for a political organisation, attracted much too narrow a range of international support. If they wish to be widely accepted as a negotiating partner, they must unequivocally accept the only fully justified condition set by the international Quartet — the cessation of violence — underline that their objective is a two-state settlement, and win international friends for the ending of the occupation. In whoever's hands, bombs, bullets, rockets and iron bars will achieve nothing. But a push for justice will. •This article was originally written for the Times but not published"

"C05769739"	"Welcome back to an unbelievable snowy mess in DC! I wanted to tell you that I met with the Lithuanian official who is heading up the Community of Democracies. Lithuania has the lead for the next two years. They are extremely energetic and recognize that CD needs to be reinvigorated. It was not given much leadership from us during the Bush years and besides democracy got a bad name — among other reasons. Their plan is to create a few working groups focused on issues that are current and important with specific practical goals and tangible results — among them, one will be focused on women and their critical role. As you know, they have a female president, the EU has just established a Gender Institute in Vilnius and they remember Vital Voices when you headed up the conference in Iceland and the successor conference which was held in Lithuania in 2001. We talked about a more concerted commitment -- to advocating for women and the role they need to play in conflict resolution (1325), helping women in Afghanistan and working to help women in eastern Europe and the Caucuses where things appear to be going backwards in many ways (takes me back to our first-ever VV conference in Vienna). I agreed that we would co-chair the gender working group with Lithuania. The Lithuanians believe that in many ways the younger generation takes for granted what the older generation fought for (they remember being a \"Captive Nation and how the US kept them going with an embassy when they was little likelihood at the time that they'd ever become a democracy), and that today democracies are struggling in too many places. It's as though we have to take back democracy's good name and focus it as a universal value to address the critical challenges. Mike Posner has the lead on CD. I talked to him about all of this. He is all for our doing the gender working group as something tangible. He is concerned about where the Community of Democracies goes more broadly. Since this was a creation of the Clinton Administration and since democracy is under siege in so many places, I hope we will find a way to work with the Lithuanians and others who still want to see it make a difference. In some ways it may be more relevant today. They are planning the first ministerial in Krakow in July and hoping so much that you will be a part of it. Assuming I can get there, I'm going to their embassy in the morning where several government reps of participating countries will be meeting to announce next steps, including the gender working group."

"C05769875"	"Our clips service doesn't have the license necessary to provide FT (or Reuters) content, so here's the long awaited FT profile -you'll be especially interested in the guest column David Milliband wrote: An FT interview with Hillary Clinton By Daniel Dombey FT June 11 2010 22:21 This is what it is like to be Hillary Clinton. The motorcade, twisting and skidding through rain-splashed streets for more than an hour; the public meetings and camera lights at journey's end; the spotlight that has not let up for two decades. It is almost as if the 2008 US presidential election - hailed as the most exciting for a generation - had never ended. But this is a campaign without a vote. Today, Clinton's convoy is snaking through Sao Paulo, Brazil, not South Hampton, New Hampshire. She herself is no longer an aspirant for the White House, despite what the overnight flights, town hall meetings and strategy sessions that make up her gruelling schedule might suggest. Instead, she is in Latin America to shore up relations with the region and promote a new idea of US leadership, one very much built around herself. She's had bigger and more ecstatic audiences than the 700-odd students and staff crammed into the hall tonight at Zumbi dos Pradares, an Afro-Brazilian university, but she's still greeted by a wave of raised arms as the audience snaps away at her with their mobile phones. In the convoy moments before, she was wrapped in a shawl, suffering from a cold and angry at the delays that pushed us into the side streets speckled with box-like bars, warehouses and love hotels while Brazilian motorists sought to cut into our path. There is no sign of that now. With the metabolism of a born politician, she feeds off the energy of her audience and takes questions from students, teachers and local celebrities for an hour. Hillary Clinton never looks happier than when she is centre stage. Most US secretaries of state wouldn't bother with this sort of event, much less initiate it and arrange for it to be screened on the biggest local channel. Yet this is what Clinton does on almost every foreign trip - and she seems to spend half her life on her official 727, crammed with long-time aides and armed bodyguards. The schedule is backbreaking and constantly shifting. She has notched up more than a quarter of a million miles since taking office. On this Latin America trip, thrown into confusion by an earthquake in Chile, we have already visited four countries in 24 hours. We go to tiny Uruguay, where our stay is so brief we check into a hotel just for a shower; Argentina, where we spend almost all our time at the presidential palace; Chile itself, where we don't leave the airport; and Brazil, where we spend almost a full day. So what exactly is Clinton trying to do on this never-ending world tour? Travelling with her for a week, talking to people inside and outside the administration, I tried to find out. \"We now have a case to make and it is not just a case that is made to the president or the prime minister or the foreign minister or an ambassador,\" she tells me a few weeks later, as she perches on a sofa in her expansive office, with its view of the Lincoln Memorial. \"People now have a voice and an opinion and a vote in many instances on the direction that their own societies take ... I want to model a different kind of leadership that is open and willing to listen but [also] to stand our ground if necessary.\" She argues that these trips of hers help to restore the US's image in the wake of the Bush administration - by making contact with public opinion abroad, and so boosting American power. Her aides say that, as a battle-hardened politician who also happens to be one of the most famous women in the world, she is ideally placed to carry out the task. But the deeper question is whether she is merely implementing the foreign policy crafted by Barack Obama, her boss and former rival, or whether her role - and ambitions - go beyond that. Is she a kind of saleswoman-in-chief for the US, I ask? \"Well, I think that is part of the job,\" she replies, toying with the napkin underneath her glass of water. \"If you are making a case for American values and for American leadership, you have to make it where people now get information ... Given the bridges we had to build and some of the repair work we had to do, we had to travel.\" As in S'ao Paulo, her system is under strain - \"I've been fighting this all day,\" she says as she masks a cough set off by her allergies (Washington's cherry blossom trees are shedding their flowers). Life is still hectic - the volcanic ash cloud has just all but paralysed Europe and televisions throughout the State Department are showing the first British election debate. But Clinton remains enthusiastic, affable and unhurried, her speech peppered with exclamations such as \"oh my gosh\", even as she discusses issues of state. She politely asks if I have any updates for her about Europe's airspace shutdown and tells me she's been talking to Norway's foreign minister about it. \"He said that this dust gets into engines of any size, even Air Force One - it's chunky! I don't know how else to describe it,\" she says, an odd note of hilarity entering her voice as she pronounces the word \"chunky\". Clinton often speaks in this eager, unvarnished way - a world away from the clipped, on-message manner of her immediate predecessor in the post, Condoleezza Rice. If anything, she is an undiplomat - known less for calibrated circumlocutions than for her plain speaking and sometimes her gaffes, a woman who retains both a formidable political constituency and a laugh she once admitted can send cats scurrying from a room. Her staff point out she is only the third elected politician in 60 years to have served as secretary of state, and the first to come from outside the foreign policy establishment since James Baker, George H.W. Bush's right-hand man and perhaps her most illustrious recent predecessor. She may be the most substantive politician in the office since William Jennings Bryan, the three-time presidential candidate who served as secretary almost a century ago. \"Her stature on the world stage, her almost presidential stature, has set her apart,\" Bill Burns, the top career diplomat at the State Department, tells me. \"Leaders want to meet her. And the town hall meetings do make a difference with public opinion.\" State visitor Hillary Clinton is greeted by Air Force Base Commander Colonel Celso de Araujo at S'ao Paulo airport in March Back in Sao Paulo, the meeting at the university ranges far from the confines and dramatis personae of traditional diplomacy. Annie, a young woman with red and blue dreadlocked hair, tells Clinton about her dance and percussion classes and asks how to study in the US without paying college fees. A nervous young man confesses himself lost halfway through an abstruse question about tariff policy; Clinton, smiling and nodding in that vaguely automatic way of hers, bears with him all the same. Another female student asks for an autograph. When answering, Clinton sometimes opens her eyes wide as she emphasises a phrase; at other moments, seemingly at random, she pulls her hands apart as if demonstrating the size of a fish. Then a law student called Marina asks about abortion - which is illegal in Brazil - and Clinton moves into treacherous terrain. She speaks of the Brazilian hospital she visited in the 1990s that treated not just expectant mothers but women suffering from the consequences of backstreet abortions. \"Wealthy women have rights in every country,\" she says. \"And poor women don't.\" Her strength of feeling can't be hidden as she denounces \"the great toll that illegal abortions take and the denial of women being able to exercise such a fundamental personal right\". Tom Shannon, the US ambassador to Brazil, tells me later: \"I understand the possible concern that we might have come close to domestic issues. But she wasn't laying out a prescription for Brazil. She was sharing her experience as a woman in American politics and as secretary of state.\" It's true: Clinton doesn't quite cross the line. Onstage, she is controlled without seeming artificial, convivial without appearing over-effusive, what a previous age would call a real trouper. At the podium she looks straight ahead, her lips carefully expressionless. Still, the old competitive instincts haven't left her. Perhaps it is the lecterns at press conferences, reminiscent of the Democratic presidential debates, but on exiting the podium at a joint appearance with Argentina's president Cristina Fernandez, Clinton makes clear her satisfaction at having had the last word. The expert debater who usually bested Obama has not left the stage. Yet that competitive urge coexists with what one insider describes as her \"almost inhuman loyalty\" towards Obama. Her mastery of the facts - an \"information carnivore\" one of her officials calls her - comes despite the consensus in much of Washington that her role consists largely of implementing the foreign policy Obama and his inner circle have framed, rather than helping frame it herself. In Sao Paulo, she shows her loyalty in striking fashion when she is asked repeatedly about positive discrimination - another sensitive topic in Brazil - not least because, Clinton herself observes, Afro- Brazilians account for more than half the country's population but only 2 per cent of university students. \"That suggests to me that some special steps need to be taken [in] recruiting and admitting students so that they can have a chance to succeed,\" she tells the hall, again inching towards domestic politics, before speaking of her pride in the progress the US civil rights movement has made in the past half-century. She says: \"The election of Barack Obama, many believe, was the greatest accomplishment of all because it demonstrated that an African-American could be elected president of the United States.\" Among the crowd, I catch my breath and scribble down her words. It's hard to think of a more fulsome statement from the woman who fought so hard against Obama - and who squandered a huge poll lead and millions of dollars in the struggle against him. The great collaborator Clinton has established strong working relationships within the Obama administration When I ask Clinton later about how she managed to move from the antagonism of the primary race to the obedience of office, she dismisses my question with an anodyne \"that's politics\". She adds: \"We're working really hard and well together ... It just never comes up any more, it seems like ancient history to me.\" Not so ancient, I think, that she is willing to admit the failings of her campaign. \"I always run inclusive and successful organisations,\" she retorts when I ask her whether she'd applied any lessons from that searing experience to her new post. She admits she didn't want the job at State - she says she was exhausted by the election and missed the Senate -. \"but at the end of the day, I'm pretty old-fashioned and if the president asks you to do something, you'd better have a really good reason why you can't.\" Also, she adds: \"Suppose I had won and I were asking him to be in my cabinet ... I would have wanted him to say yes.\" Others say the relationship is more complex, that by dint of her loyalty and unflagging hard work, Clinton has moved closer to the charmed circle and made herself an even more formidable political force than before. \"Quite simply, she gives good advice and the president over a year and a half has recognised that,\" says Anne-Marie Slaughter, head of the State Department policy planning unit. \"The relationship is based on her performance in the job.\" By all accounts, it's a collaborative partnership, though not perhaps a warm one. Clinton boasts a good working relationship with the main players of the administration - and has formed something of an alliance with defence secretary Robert Gates, although on life-and-death issues such as Afghanistan, it is Gates, not her, who has taken the lead. As one official told me, secretaries of state have often either been popular with their own department - Colin Powell comes to mind - or with the rest of the administration - as was Condoleezza Rice - but Clinton has managed to be both. In truth, Clinton's language remains harder-edged than Obama's - she recently claimed that Iran's Revolutionary Guard had staged a slow-motion coup - and she has sometimes been more willing than he is to hint at using the military. \"She seems to step up with a bit of spine just at the right time,\" says Kurt Volker, a US ambassador to Nato under George W. Bush. She has also assumed an ever more prominent role in talking to leaders such as Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan - apparently because she is trusted both by them and Obama. Meanwhile, she has been careful to keep her husband, the former US president, in the background. Aides say they have barely seen him in the building - though Clinton herself says that behind the scenes Bill Clinton gives her strategic advice. \"One of his favourite sayings, that I remind myself of all the time, is a kind of baseball saying,\" she says: \"Don't major in the minors; keep your eye on not just the headlines but the trend lines.\" It is her co-operative stance rather than any notable effort to set out a grand vision of her own that is the chief theme of her time so far at State. When I ask Clinton to name her proudest achievement in office, she replies \"the effective and collaborative approach that this administration has taken towards identifying and solving problems.\" A more process-oriented, less provocative answer would be hard to imagine. But maybe, I think, the US has less scope for grand strategy than it did in the past couple of decades, when the country seemed to bestride the world colossus-style. Clinton herself suggests that so formidable are the tasks confronting the US that the administration has little scope to enter into internecine fights but needs instead to focus on the challenges to hand. Whatever the reason for her stance, it seems to be a smart decision - by all accounts she's overcome many of the suspicions the White House retinue had towards her. \"It's fair to say that she was not born into the administration's inner circle but slowly but surely, for the most consequential decisions, she now has a prime seat at the table,\" says one official. Praising what he calls her \"Terminator-quality durability and determination,\" he adds: \"She's done an amazing amount of work, judging that the way to build a strategic vision is bottom up, by mastering the details.\" Indeed, Clinton's ability to master the most arcane foreign policy briefs is the marvel of her building. She has dropped into obscure working groups and shown an unnerving knowledge of their details. At her confirmation hearings last year she exchanged facts about the arctic with an Alaskan senator; at the meeting in So Paulo she becomes enthused about freight transport policy both in Brazil and the US. She herself acknowledges that finding her feet on foreign policy was something of a struggle, despite her campaign claims of expertise in the field. \"It was so intellectually challenging, just to get our arms around all of these issues,\" she says. During her first year, she was criticised for apparent gaffes - including the way she called for Israel to halt all building of settlements on occupied territory only to hail a partial freeze a few months later as unprecedented. On an election campaign, she says, \"you may be in a different city four times a day but you have a message you're trying to deliver that is repetitive and aimed at your audience. But here you might deal with 10 different countries' problems, six different regional or global challenges in the course of a day.\" As the Latin America tour shows, she is now trying to do both - travel incessantly and solve an array of international issues. She is at the forefront of the US's efforts to consolidate relations with a number of important countries - predominantly Russia and China, but also rising powers such as Brazil, Turkey, Indonesia and South Africa - and to cool down anti-American feeling in hotspots, notably Pakistan. She says the push is working, hailing a \"change in public opinion in places that were pretty negative about the US\" - a reference to Russia and Pakistan. But it is far from smooth sailing. Differences about Iran and over Israel's raid on aid-bearing ships off Gaza have stoked tensions with Turkey and Brazil recently, amid questioning of the effectiveness of the Obama administration's policies. During my time with her on the road, the stop in Brazil is the focal point - not surprising given the country's increased profile as Latin America leader. Clinton is now heading the administration's push to secure sanctions on Iran, and in Brasilia she tries and fails to win President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to her cause. She employs an almost combative tone at a press conference with Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign minister. At moments she appears to barely contain her irritation, as she denounces \"an Iran that runs to Brazil\" as well as other countries such as Turkey and China \"telling different things to different people to avoid international sanctions\". Amorim is spiky in his own way - drawing parallels to the 1990s sanctions on Iraq and the claims about weapons of mass destruction before the 2003 war. \"Of course, I don't agree with everything the Secretary said,\" he says. It is not a happy experience - indeed this past week both Brazil and Turkey voted against sanctions at the United Nations - yet Hillary Clinton is nowhere near giving up. Years ago, one of Bill Clinton's biographers described his approach to government as a \"permanent campaign\", and it appears to be his wife's preferred form of existence as well. If there is one constant in Clinton's life, it is that she never throws in her cards, whether what motivates her is power or public service. \"Never, never!\" she exclaims, when I ask whether she ever thought of walking off into the wings after the frustrations and indignities of her time at the White House. \"I have a very realistic sense of what high- stakes politics requires and it took me a while to get there because it's shocking when you are in the arena ... but once you figure it out, you can take it seriously for purposes of analysis and understanding, but you can't take it personally.\" Such treatment seems to rankle all the same. She's been listening to coverage ahead of the British debate and is plainly irritated by the coverage of the leaders' wives. \"Whether a woman's running for office or she's supporting her husband who's running for office and she gets criticised for wearing open-toed shoes or for the colour of her coat, there's just a lot of history that you bear if you are a woman who puts herself out in the political arena,\" she says. Another country Clinton boards her official 727 to fly from Sao Paulo to Costa Rica Injustice towards women appears to be the issue that most enthuses Clinton in this job - as in her many other incarnations in American public life, whether as First Lady or before. \"I feel passionately it is in not just the American national security interests but the world's, that women be given the opportunities and the tools to make the most out of their own lives,\" she says. In the 1990s she steered clear of reading the newspapers because of the way she was treated. Today, she says, \"I certainly don't read coverage of me, I read what else is going on that I need to know about to do my job.\" \"It's all baloney,\" says Philippe Reines, her press adviser, who set up the meeting with her and is sitting to one side in her office. \"Yeah, yeah, right, that's what he tells me,\" Clinton responds. I wonder. She may not read the stories about her, but she has boosted her domestic profile still further by talking to American magazines such as Esquire, Vogue and Parade. To what end? Clinton has said she will only serve one four-year term as secretary of state - understandable, given the grind of the job. When I ask whether she expects a woman president in the next decade or so, she responds: \"I'd love that, obviously I would love that. I want to be front and centre when it happens.\" \"Any chance it would be you?\" I ask. \"No, no, I don't think that's in the cards,\" Clinton says. She's given more categoric denials in the past. \"I think that there's a whole generation of young women and not so young, but mature, seasoned women who are earning their stripes and recognising how tough it is out there. It is not for the faint of heart to run for president, and I believe it is harder for women, it just is, and that's just a fact.\" But, says one US official, \"all the profiles and all this media treatment undercut the argument that she is finished with electoral politics. Why do all this stuff? She's already Hillary Clinton. You have to ask: 'What's the idea behind raising her domestic profile still further?\" Indeed she is now, by some counts, the most popular politician in America and some in Washington say she could be a good fit for the vice-presidential slot in the 2012 elections. Back in Sao Paulo, once the town hall meeting is over, Clinton faces a seven-hour flight to Costa Rica. The journey goes on and on, and as saleswoman-in-chief for the US in an unruly world, she faces a long, hard road. Today the US sometimes struggles to assert itself on the world stage. But the obstacles are rather fewer if the product she is pitching is herself. A secretary of state like none before her, Hillary Clinton, long one of the most formidable figures in US politics, is looking stronger than ever. Daniel Dombey is the FT's US diplomatic correspondent David Miliband: \"Hillary is a rock star ... she has a great sense of fun, and a great sense of humour\" It's too early to start chalking up a scorecard because Hillary Clinton, and the Obama administration, is laying the foundations for long-term change in America's foreign policy. The challenges are immense - probably more difficult than the inheritance of any previous administration. But American leadership is essential and a commitment to multilateralism - in fact multi, multilateralism using different and overlapping forums - is real and right. You also have to remember that Hillary is a rock star. When I arrived at the Nato Foreign Ministers meeting in March 2009, it was a nice surprise that all the staff, never mind the press, seemed to have turned out in droves for my arrival. Then I realised that Hillary was 10 minutes behind me. That said, the thing that most surprised me about working with Clinton was not her intelligence or her hard work, all of which are well known, but that behind the serious exterior is someone who has a great sense of fun, and a great sense of humour. She has seen politics from all sides, and can laugh at herself as well as at others. She's a remarkably good listener, always synthesising ideas and opinions to develop her own. She thinks strategically as well as tactically. She's also very, very unpompous. Hillary is a very political person but in a particular way, she honours politics and public service and believes that democratic politics is not a necessary evil, but a calling of value and vocation. She knows you win some and you lose some, but it's essential to take part. There's one other thing. Hillary is a people person in that she thinks deeply about the psychology of the people she's dealing with. Their motivation, their loyalties, their culture. It's real emotional intelligence in trying to understand why people disagree and how you can get them to agree. I think that must be why so many other members of the administration say she is a very good colleague. David Miliband is shadow foreign secretary Gideon Rachman: \"Relations between the White House and the State Department are not particularly close\" A school teacher asked to write a report on Hillary Clinton's stint as secretary of state would have to give her 10/10 for effort but a rather more modest mark for actual achievements - maybe a six or a seven. Secretaries of state are generally judged on two criteria. First, how have they done in the endless bureaucratic turf wars that characterise Washington politics? Second, how effective have they been in promoting US foreign policy in the wider world? Success in one area usually helps in the other. Henry Kissinger was a superb Washington infighter - and his close relationship with President Nixon made him all the more effective overseas. Colin Powell, George W. Bush's first secretary of state, was widely admired outside the US - but came out on the wrong side of many of the Washington battles, which limited his ability to get things done in the wider world. Hillary Clinton has skilfully avoided being sucked into the debilitating Washington struggles that so damaged Powell. Despite the often poisonous rivalry between the Obama and Clinton camps during the campaign, Clinton has a good working relationship with the president. But while relations between the White House and the State Department are cordial, they do not seem to be particularly close. Clinton appointed many loyalists from her own campaign to the State Department, with the result that State is rather detached from Obama's inner circle. Obama's penchant for making high-profile speeches in foreign capitals such as Cairo, Prague, Tokyo and Istanbul means that the president himself has done more than anyone else to define his administration's approach to the world. That still leaves a role for Clinton to fill in the crucial details of policy. But special representatives have been appointed to deal with Afghanistan and the Middle East - and the Treasury is critical to China policy. Asked about Clinton's impact as secretary of state, one senior European policymaker purses his lips and says: \"She's done some great trips, and she's highly professional. But it's hard to see any particular area where she has really driven policy.\" Gideon Rachman is the FT's chief foreign affairs columnist David Rothkopf: \"When she has been asked to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly\" Hillary Clinton has been a cautious secretary of state: she has protected the president well and pursued his agenda without upstaging him - an early concern, given her stature. She has worked very well with other members of the cabinet, and is reconsidering the role and structure of the State Department. That includes a review of the role of diplomacy going forward. Clinton has not only acknowledged the rise of new powers and a changing global power structure but has taken steps to reshape US foreign policy structure accordingly. An important part of that has been recognising the importance of co-operating with private and non-state actors such as NG0s, as well as dealing with non-state threats. When the administration has called upon her to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly. This has allowed the president to articulate a strategic vision which Clinton then goes about implementing. Still, neither the secretary of state nor the president determines the global situation. The US may be the most powerful country in the world but it is one among many powerful countries, and many aspects of the situation we face today are beyond our control. The Obama administration has been dealt an extremely difficult hand: not only Iraq and Afghanistan, but Iran and North Korea's nuclear programmes, the rise of emerging powers and a complex and still unfolding series of financial crises. We have gone from a world in which the US thought it had limitless resources and unbounded options to one where the limits are clear; from a world in which you could work in the GB to one where you have to work in the context of the G20; a world where new technologies and new powers play a bigger role. All of those things would dictate a change in foreign policy regardless of who is in office. Hillary Clinton has established a very solid foundation. The next step is to identify a couple of signature issues - and have a couple of signature successes. That will take her to the next level.

He filed this report: Minutes after Landon Donovan scored the stunning extra-time goal that won a critical World Cup match against Algeria, Bill Clinton and several of his aides and friends (including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe) were escorted downstairs to the U.S. team's locker room. The American players roared with pride as the former president (and honorary chairman of the committee bidding to bring the World Cup to the U.S. in 2018 or 2022) walked in. After a round of embraces, handshakes and high fives, he spoke briefly about his joy in their victory: \"I'm proud of you because you didn't let the frustration of all the shots that you almost made get you down. You are amazing!\" Much posing for pictures ensued with the shirtless, whooping, chest-bumping players -- who couldn't quite seem to believe they had done it. The team then invited Clinton alone to join them in the inner locker room, where he could be glimpsed toasting them with a beer amid much additional hollering. When he emerged 10 minutes or so later, he had a broad smile and a hoarse voice. As Clinton left for Johannesburg, where he will meet tomorrow with former President Nelson Mandela, one of the players chased him out into the hall and handed one of the former president's aides an official ball signed by all the members of Team USA. Clinton stopped for just a moment to talk with the local press before disappearing in a convoy of flashing lights and sirens. \"If it hadn't been the decisive game, even I would have said it should have been a tie,\" he said. \"It was a great game. You know, all great contests become head games at some point -- sports, elections, wars. And they [Team USA] have good heads and good hearts.\""

"C05770377"	"August 8, 2010 Gary Sick America and Iran: Strikes, Sanctions and Scapegoats For the pundits, there are only two questions about U.S.-Iran relations that are of any importance: (1) Will Israel and/or the United States attack Iran? and (2) will the new sanctions have enough bite to persuade Iran to change its nuclear policy? Despite all the printers ink spilled on these two issues, the answers are an easy no and no. Neither the United States nor Israel will take the military option off the table, thereby giving the pundits (and the crowd that is dying to repeat Iraq) latitude to keep the distant prospect of military action on the front pages, where it has been for years. As a lede, it sells columns and newspapers, so it will not go away. But as analysis it is either blinded by the momentary hype or else is simple wish fulfillment. Uber-neocon John Bolton had it right. If any such attack were to occur, it would have been at the end of the Bush administration when there was nothing left to lose. Bolton thought it was so inevitable that he predicted it unequivocally in a Wall Street Journal column in 2008. Dick Cheney apparently agreed, judging from his subsequent statements of regret. So it is fair to say that George W. Bush, after looking the potential consequences, resisted the advice of his neocon advisers, his previously dominant vice president, and the reported direct request from the government of Israel — and rejected a strike. What is the likelihood that Barack Obama, with the same catastrophic scenario before him, will approve? Forget it. Sanctions do not persuade dictatorial regimes to abandon projects that they think are central to their security and survival or even their self-image. Just look at Saddam Hussein. The international sanctions imposed on Iraq in the 1980s make the current Iran sanctions appear anemic in comparison. Every item that went in and out of Iraq was subject to approval by a UN committee dominated by a vindictive United States. Yet, although Iraq had abandoned its nuclear weapons program years earlier, Saddam could not bring himself to let his own people and his enemies know that. Instead he was prepared to gamble that the United States would not attack him. One of the reasons for this bad bet was that he and his cronies were doing so well under the sanctions that there was no immediate necessity to come clean. They, after all, controlled the smuggling routes. And their henchmen managed the thriving and enormously lucrative black market. As for concern with their own people, a rotund Tariq Aziz, sitting with a fine Scotch and a Cuban cigar, informed a worried UN representative that it would be good for the Iraqi people to lose some weight. An Iraqi friend of mine told me at the time that the sanctions had made criminals of the entire Iraqi middle class, which had to resort to illegal behavior in order to survive. The biggest – and most successful – of this new criminal class was the privileged group immediately around Saddam Hussein. Which brings us to Iran. The sanctions are more effective than many anticipated. They have built a web of financial restrictions and limitations around the already weak Iranian economy that is certain to cause significant problems for the leadership. Iran's critical energy sector is particularly vulnerable. It is in a pincer. Because of cheap energy prices inside the country, artificially propped up by massive subsidies, energy demand is soaring. This siphons off a lot of Iran's oil production, which would otherwise be sold on the world market for hard currency. At the same time, because Iran's oil fields are old and complex, they require modern technology to maintain production. That technology – and the capital investment that can only be provided by the major international oil companies – has been absent for many years. It was driven away partly by the sanctions, ironically assisted by Iran's own short-sighted negotiating tactics that offered only the most meager profit margins to outside investors. As a result, Iran's oil production is in decline at the same time that more and more of it is being soaked up by domestic consumption. In a period of relatively low oil prices, this means that Iran's hard currency earnings are drying up at an alarming rate. This unenviable economic situation is compounded by what has to be described as perhaps the least competent economic management team of any major country in the world. Ayatollah Khamene'i, the Supreme Leader, seems totally preoccupied with bolstering his own shaky political legitimacy by pandering to the Revolutionary Guards who surround and protect him. The result is corruption on a scale beyond anything the shah's regime could have imagined. President Ahmadinejad, also a creature of the Revolutionary Guards, is free to indulge his taste for outlandish and irresponsible rhetoric. His words keep the international and domestic spotlight glued to him; but the effect drives away prospective investors and facilitates the U.S. drive to enlist international support for sanctions against Iran. An American Jewish leader once joked with me that he suspected Ahmadinejad was a Mossad agent: no one, he observed, had been more helpful in promoting donations to Israel and Israeli causes. At the same time, under his leadership Iran has inflation and unemployment that are both in double digits. But to be fair, Ahmadinejad is the first politician in modern Iranian history willing to address the \"third rail\" of Iranian politics — the immensely costly subsidies on food and energy. His initial efforts to reduce the amount of subsidized gasoline that Iranians could use met with outbursts of indignation, including torching filling stations. But these rules now seem to be grudgingly accepted and have eased slightly Iran's energy dilemma. He is now addressing the low tax rates assessed against merchants. This has also resulted in outrage, including closing the bazaars in Iran and other major cities. But his campaign seems to be making progress. These are needed reforms that would be recommended by any responsible economic overseer, including the International Monetary Fund. Ahmadinejad attempts to balance his daring assaults on the entrenched economic interests by his belligerent rhetoric, always casting himself as the champion of the little guy. In that he resembles his populist predecessors, from Juan Peron to Huey Long to Hugo Chavez. Ahmadinejad takes on America and Israel the way Governor Long took on Standard Oil. But like other populists, Ahmadinejad is the prisoner of his own eccentric view of the world and his loyalty to lieutenants who may or may not be worthy of his faith in them. The key question about Iran today is not whether it will be attacked or collapse under sanctions. It is whether Iran is capable under its present leadership to take a sober decision about how to deal with the outside world. The Revolutionary Guards have established a dominant position in Iran's military, its economy, and its politics. Iran increasingly comes to resemble the corporatist states of southern and eastern Europe in the 1920s and '30s that we call fascist. Iran is conducting an interior battle with its own demons, from the millenarians on the far right who choose to believe that Khamene'i is the personal representative of God on earth, to the pragmatic conservatives who simply want a more responsible leadership, to the reformists of the Green movement whose objective is to put the \"republic\" back into the Islamic Republic by giving the people a greater voice. This is a yeasty and unpredictable mix. No one knows what is going to happen next. And this is the reality that the Obama administration must deal with. The danger is not that the administration will back the wrong horse in Iran. The real danger is that the Obama administration will be so preoccupied with domestic American politics and its constant demand to look tough when dealing with Iran that it will inadvertently rescue this cruel but hapless regime from its own ineptitude by providing a convenient scapegoat for everything that goes wrong in Iran."

"C05770565"	"WASHINGTON (AP) - The Obama administration targeted key leaders of Afghanistan's Taliban with new financial sanctions Thursday in a move that could complicate relations with Pakistan and Afghan efforts to reconcile with insurgents. The action by the Treasury Department will freeze the militants' assets, ban travel and trigger an arms embargo. It follows similar action by the United Nations earlier this week, and comes after calls from Gen. David Petraeus, the top military commander in Afghanistan, and Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, for sanctions against Afghan insurgent commanders operating in Pakistan. Taken together, the U.S. and U.N. sanctions prohibit any financial transactions of the terror leaders in U.N. member countries, putting additional pressure on Pakistan to take broader actions against the Taliban militants. Three financial kingpins were targeted with sanctions, including a key member of the Haqqani network, which,directs operations against U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan from safe havens in Pakistan. Among those sanctioned Thursday was Nasiruddin Haqqani, an emissary for the Haqqani Network and brother of Sirajuddin Haqqani who leads the group with his father, Jalaluddin. Others sanctioned included Gul Agha Ishakzai, the head of the Taliban's financial commission and Amir Abdullah, the former treasurer to captured Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Barader. The sanctions placed on the three leaders as terrorists would deprive them of the assets they need to fund their terror operations, said Adam J. Szubin, director of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. \"We will continue to aggressively work to expose and dismantle the financial networks of terrorist groups in support of the president's goal of a stable Afghanistan,\" he said. According to officials, lshakzai is the head of the Taliban's financial commission, has collected money for suicide attacks in Kandahar, Afghanistan, and has been involved in the disbursement of funds for Taliban fighters. He has served as a main financial officer and close adviser to Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar. Abdullah has reportedly traveled to Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Libya and the United Arab Emirates to raise money for the Taliban and facilitate meetings and communications with key leaders. Nasiruddin Haqqani has collected funds for the Haqqani group, including from al- Qaida. Last week, Gen. David Petraeus, the top military commander in Afghanistan, urged officials to add commanders from the Haqqani network to the terrorist list. At the time, administration officials said a review was under way, largely accelerated after the May 1 failed Times Square bombing. The man who has pleaded guilty in the New York incident, Pakistani-born American Faisal Shahzad, said he trained with the Pakistani Taliban to build bombs, then returned to the U.S. to launch an attack that would avenge attacks on Muslims by U.S. forces overseas."

"C05770950"	"Published on The New Republic (http://www.tnr.com) The Unnecessary Fall A counter-history of the Obama presidency. • John B. Judis • August 12, 2010 I 12:00 am On April 14, 2009, as Barack Obama's standing in the polls was beginning to slip, and as Tea Party demonstrators were amassing in Washington for tax day protests, the president gave a lengthy address atGeorgetown University explaining the \"five pillars\" of his economic policies. The speech was intended to promote a memorable slogan for Obama's program that would evoke comparisons with Theodore Roosevelt's Square Deal, Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, and Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. Obama's contribution was to be the New Foundation. \"We must lay a new foundation for growth and prosperity—a foundation that will move us from an era of borrow and spend to one where we save and invest,\" he declared. Obama would repeat the phrase seven times that day and on many more occasions over the next months. At Obama's private White House dinner with presidential historians that June, the historians were no more impressed than the public with the New Foundation as a slogan. \"I don't think it's going to work,\" Robert Dallek warned. Doris Kearns Goodwin said it sounded \"like a woman's girdle.\" One of these historians might have been able to forewarn Obama that the slogan had been unsuccessfully deployed by a Democratic president once before. In his 1979 State of the Union address, Jimmy Carter began, \"Tonight, I want to examine in a broad sense the state of our American Union—how we are building a new foundation for a peaceful and a prosperous world.\" Carter would use the phrase five times in the speech, including in its conclusion, where he asked members of Congress to join him \"in building that new foundation.\" Like Obama's effort, the phrase inspired, at most, a few underwear jokes and was then forgotten. Obama's evocation of Carter was obviously unintended—but the Man from Plains is indeed the specter now hanging over his presidency. Of course, Obama has already accomplished more in his first 20 months than Jimmy Carter did during his entire presidency. But there is a disturbing political resemblance between the two presidencies. Both men ran inspired campaigns in which they positioned themselves above the scandals and partisan quarrels of their predecessors and initially stirred hopes of a \"transformational\" presidency. But, as presidents, both men somehow failed to connect with large parts of the electorate. To be sure, there are a number of very specific reasons why Carter and Obama landed in political trouble. Both men contended with rising unemployment—Carter with rampant inflation as well—and voters' approval of a president and his party tend to track closely with changes in the economy. Carter faced friction in his own party and the rise of a powerful business lobby, and Obama has dealt with a Republican Party that has frustrated his dreams of a post-partisan presidency. Yet the most important reason for their difficulties—evident in their inept attempts to brand their programs—has been an inability to develop a politics that resonates with the public. In the United States, politics pivots around the allegiance of the middle class, even as its identity has changed from yeoman farmers and mechanics to store clerks, office workers, x-ray technicians, and small business owners. They are, in Bill Clinton's words, \"those who work hard and play by the rules.\" They are the central characters in a populist rhetoric that goes back to the early republic. It depicts the middle class as embattled and threatened either from forces below (impoverished immigrants, welfare cheaters, ghetto rioters) or above (Wall Street speculators, state bureaucrats, K Street lobbyists). Populism can be embraced by Glenn Beck or Tom Harkin. It is intrinsically neither left-wing nor right-wing. Politicians, such as Franklin Roosevelt or Ronald Reagan, who found a way of using populism's appeal during downturns have enjoyed success, while those who have spurned it have suffered accordingly. If, in circumstances like the present one, you don't develop a populist politics, your adversaries will use populism to define you as an enemy of the people. That's what Carter discovered during the stagflation of the late '70s. And that's what has happened in the last 20 months of the Great Recession to Barack Obama and to the Democratic Party he leads. Obama took office with widespread popular support, even among Republicans, and some of his first efforts, including the $800 billion stimulus, initially enjoyed strong public favor. But that wide appeal began to dissipate by the late spring of 2009. Disillusion with Obama fueled the November defeat of Democratic gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey and Virginia. By January 2010, it was a crucial factor in Republican Scott Brown's astonishing victory over Martha Coakley in Massachusetts. In the postmortem debate over these defeats, some Democrats have blamed Obama's dogged pursuit of health care reform while the economy was hemorrhaging jobs. That may have been a factor, but the real damage was done earlier. What doomed Obama politically was the way he dealt with the financial crisis in the first six months of his presidency. In an atmosphere primed for a populist backlash, he allowed the right wing to define the terms. As Obama was delivering his inaugural address, the financial crisis was already in full swing; and it was already apparent that financial speculation, outright fraud, and irresponsible and sometimes illegal housing-loan practices had played a very large role in precipitating the crisis. The public was up in arms. But, instead of rallying the public against the \"money changers,\" as Roosevelt had done in his first inaugural, Obama, taking a leaf from Jimmy Carter's infamous \"malaise\" speech, put the blame on the public as a whole. \"Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age,\" he declared. Over the next month, Obama would periodically criticize bankers after embarrassing revelations—at various times calling the bonuses they gave themselves \"shameful\" and an \"outrage\"—but, after hearing complaints about his rhetoric from the bankers, he would back off. At a private meeting on March 28 with 13 Wall Street CEOs, the president, his spokesman Robert Gibbs said, \"emphasized that Wall Street needs Main Street and Main Street needs Wall Street.\" And, in his Georgetown speech, Obama returned to his theme of collective responsibility. The recession, Obama said, \"was caused by a perfect storm of irresponsibility and poor decision-making that stretched from Wall Street to Washington to Main Street.\" Obama's policy followed the same swerving course as his rhetoric. One week, he would favor harsh restrictions on bank and insurance-company bonuses, but, the next week, he would waver; one week, he would support legislation allowing bankruptcy judges to reduce the amount that homeowners threatened with foreclosure owed the banks; the next week, he would fail to protest when bank lobbyists pressured the Senate to kill these provisions. But, more importantly, Obama—in sharp contrast to Roosevelt in his first months—failed to push Congress to immediately enact new financial regulations or even to set up a commission to investigate fraud. (When Congress finally appointed a commission in July 2009, Obama and his party put a milquetoast Democratic politician, former California State Treasurer Philip Angelides, in charge of it.) Obama's appointments also conveyed an impression that he wanted to let Wall Street off the hook. He appointed Timothy Geithner to be treasury secretary. Geithner claimed that he was not part of Wall Street, but, in his capacity as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, he had served under a board of directors headed by JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. As New York Fed president, Geithner had been partly responsible for the decision to let Lehman Brothers go under, for the unpopular tarp program, and for American International Group (MG) paying back its Wall Street creditors with government money. Geithner chose as his chief of staff a former lobbyist for Goldman Sachs. Retiring Democratic Senator Byron Dorgan told me, \"Most Americans were reading about the massive compensations and bailouts, and the administration largely hired people from the culture of Wall Street.\" By the spring, Obama's apparent tilt to Wall Street had sparked a right-wing populist revolt in the country. The newly formed Tea Party movement, Beck and Fox News, and a host of right-wing bloggers were leading the charge; but, in a less extreme form, the general public shared their anger. In an early April New York Times/CBS News poll, the public disapproved of Obama's aiding the banks by 58 percent to 33 percent. In this same poll, public approval of Obama's handling of the economy began to fall. Pollsters who did focus groups also traced disillusionment with Obama's economic policies to his handling of the financial crisis. Congressman Barney Frank, who defends Obama's policies, acknowledges that the president's political difficulties began with the revelation that MG, which had received $170 billion from the government, had paid out $165 billion in bonuses to the division that had brought the company down. Geithner had known about the bonuses but insisted there were no legal grounds to block them. (It then came out that Geithner had pressured Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd to insert a provision in the stimulus bill that protected the bonuses.) \"The pitchforks were out. It added injury to injury,\" Frank says. That's when public opinion of Geithner plummeted. According to a Rasmussen poll, 24 percent had a favorable view of Geithner and 44 percent an unfavorable one. The public's view of the bank bailout and the AIG bonuses colored its view of the auto bailout, the stimulus, and health care reform. One of the rallying cries for the populist opposition to Obama was \"where's my bailout?\" (Obama himself acknowledged that it was \"one of the most frequent questions\" he was asked in letters.) The auto program became a bailout for the Big Three CEOs; the stimulus became a bailout of government itself; and health care reform was a bailout for the uninsured—or \"reparations,\" as Rush Limbaugh put it. Wrote right-wing blogger Michelle Malkin, \"hardworking citizens were getting sick of being played for chumps\" by \"moochers, big and small, corporate and individual, trampling over themselves with their hands out demanding endless bailouts.\" Obama and the Democrats were successfully portrayed as aiding \"the moochers,\" but not the \"hardworking citizens.\" In American politics, that's a recipe for political disaster. Some in the White House political operation recognized in the late spring that the administration's economic efforts were being defined by right-wing populism and tried to push Obama to take a more populist tack. A group within the White House began calling themselves the \"pitchfork gang,\" but they would find their attempts to convince Obama to get tough on Wall Street or on insurance companies undermined by Geithner and by National Economic Council head Larry Summers, who were worried about upsetting business confidence. \"There was a continual tension in the White House,\" says a person who was privy to the discussions. \"One week, we would be very hot, and then, the next week, we would dial it back.\" By early January of this year, Obama was clearly losing the battle for the middle class. According to a CNN poll, 60 percent of Americans thought Obama \"had paid more attention to the problems faced by banks and other financial institutions\" than to the \"problems faced by middle class Americans.\" Only 28 percent, barely more than a quarter, thought he had paid more attention to the middle class. As Brown surged ahead of Coakley in the polls, the White House temporarily embraced a populist approach. On January 14, Obama called the bank bonuses \"obscene\" and said, \"we want our money back.\" In a January 22 speech at Lorain County Community College in Elyria, Ohio (a far cry from Georgetown), Obama used the word \"fighting\" 13 times and \"fight\" nine times. \"I will not stop fighting for you,\" he declared. But, faced with a falling stock market and anger from Wall Street, Obama once again turned conciliatory. On February io, he said that he didn't \"begrudge\" the $17 million bonus awarded to Dimon and the $9 million to Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein. \"I know both guys. They are very savvy businessmen.\" Obama's reluctance to rail against Wall Street might have led to a watered-down financial reform bill, or even no bill at all, but, on April 16, the Securities and Exchange Commission indicted Goldman Sachs for fraud. The next week, an emboldened Obama went to New York to criticize the bankers directly for their \"failure of responsibility.\" As a result of the indictment and Obama's rediscovery of his anger, Republicans became somewhat less obstructionist, moderate Republicans broke with the party's leadership, and moderate Democrats fell into line. Congress produced a much stronger bill than the Democrats had ever expected. But Obama's embrace of populism has remained fitful and sporadic. After the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Verizon's Ivan Seidenberg, the head of the Business Roundtable, criticized Obama for being anti-business in June, the president dispatched Geithner, White House aide Valerie Jarrett, and Bill Clinton to appease the business community. Obama has said enough to anger the CEOs, but he has failed to convey to the greater public that he is fighting for them. Obama's unwillingness to buck Wall Street and the Business Roundtable, along with his delayed and muddled response to the BP disaster in the Gulf, has eroded the public's confidence in his leadership. In Pew's midyear report card on Obama's image, the greatest drop from February 2009 to this June was in the perception of Obama as a \"strong leader.\" Voters will sometimes tolerate policies they question from presidents like John Kennedy or Reagan, whom they regard as \"strong,\" but not from politicians like Jimmy Carter, whom they regard as weak. What of the other factors behind Obama's political difficulties? There is no doubt that, if the economy were growing faster, and if unemployment were dropping below 9 percent, Obama and the Democrats would be more popular and not fearing a November rout. But, unfortunately, the economy's sluggish recovery cannot be completely disentangled from the White House's weak political performance. In January, when the White House debated how large a stimulus to propose, Christina Romer, the head of the Council of Economic Advisors, proposed a $1.2 trillion Keynesian jolt. David Obey, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, told The Fiscal Times that Obama's Treasury Department asked initially for a $1.4 trillion bill. But the administration finally proposed a stimulus between $700 and $800 billion that included large tax cuts that were more likely to stimulate saving than consumption—and spending that would be unlikely to produce many jobs until the end of Obama's first term. In the stimulus's first year, the administration spent only $17 billion of the $139 billion allocated for infrastructure spending. Prominent economists, including Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, made the case that a much larger stimulus was necessary to reverse (rather than merely reduce) the rise in unemployment, and that, if a modest stimulus failed to reduce unemployment, Republicans would convince the public that the stimulus was toxic medication and would block additional Keynesian measures. That argument has been proven sadly correct. Some White House advisers appear to have underestimated the depth of the Great Recession. Others seem to have doubted the administration had the political clout to get more from Congress. But the White House might have gotten more if Obama had proclaimed a national economic emergency (which it was); framed the issue in terms of rescuing the middle class from damage done by Wall Street speculators, short-sighted CEOs, and Chinese mercantilism; and directly attacked Republicans as heartless obstructionists. When Obama belatedly made this sort of case on the eve of the financial reform vote this year, he got a much stronger bill than anyone had anticipated. So it's not clear that the failure to get a larger stimulus—which has ended up hurting the administration politically—wasn't itself a result of political timidity. The president has also suffered from an inability to explain to the public why he sought such a large stimulus and what he thought it could accomplish. Obama's New Foundation speech at Georgetown was soon forgotten. Afterward, Obama, to the dismay of Democrats in Congress and some of his White House aides, pretty much dropped the jobs issue. From then to Labor Day, he devoted a July visit to Buffalo and an August stopover in southern Indiana to the issue—at a time when the right wing was mobilizing against him. Obama didn't just fail to develop a consistent narrative about the economy; he didn't really try. Contrast Obama's attempt to develop a politics to justify his economic program with what Reagan did in 1982. Faced with steadily rising unemployment, which went from 8.6 percent in January to 10.4 percent in November, Reagan and his political staff, which included James Baker, Mike Deaver, and Ed Rollins, forged a strategy early that year calling for voters to \"stay the course\" and blaming the current economic troubles on Democratic profligacy. \"We are clearing away the economic wreckage that was dumped in our laps,\" Reagan declared. Democrats accused them of playing \"the blame game,\" but the strategy, followed to the letter by the White House for ten months, worked. The Republicans were predicted to lose as many as 50 House seats, but they lost only 26 and broke even in the Senate. Some commentators have noted Reagan's popularity was even lower than Obama's. But, on key economic questions, he did much better than Obama and the Democrats are currently performing—and voters expressed far greater patience with Reagan's program. According to polls, even as the unemployment rate climbed, a narrow plurality still expressed confidence that Reagan's program would help the economy. On the eve of the election, with the unemployment rate at a postwar high, a New York Times/CBS News poll found that 6o percent of likely voters thought Reagan's economic program would eventually help the country. That's a sign of a successful political operation. If Obama could command those numbers, Democrats could seriously limit their losses in November. But Obama has not been able to develop a narrative that could convince people to trust him and the Democrats. Why has the White House failed to convince the public that it is fighting effectively on its behalf? The principal culprit is clearly Barack Obama. He has a strange aversion to confrontational politics. His aversion is strange because he was schooled in it, working as a community organizer in the 198os, under the tutelage of activists who subscribed to teachings of the radical Saul Alinsky. But, when Obama departed for Harvard Law School in 1988, he left Alinsky and adversarial tactics behind. The young lawyer who returned to Chicago and won a seat in the Illinois state Senate in 1996 practiced a very different style of politics. Obama's principal accomplishments in Springfield were bills restricting lobbying and requiring videotaping of confessions in potential death penalty cases. He was not a typical blue-collar, bread-and-butter Chicago Democrat, but the kind of good government liberal that represents the upscale districts of the city, seeing in politics a higher calling and ill at ease with (although not in open opposition to) the city's Democratic machine. He was also a post- racial politician who eschewed the hard-edged, angry rhetoric of Jesse Jackson. (That, too, is oddly reminiscent of Carter, who partly campaigned in 1976 as the white Southern antidote to George Wallace's angry racial populism.) Obama carried this outlook into the U.S. Senate, into his campaign for the presidency, and then, into the presidency itself. He is a cerebral, dispassionate, post-partisan; he wants to \"end the political strategy that has been based on division,\" to \"turn the page\" on the culture wars of the 1960s and the partisan battles of the 1990s. During the campaign, his aides jokingly referred to him as the \"black Jesus.\" While he can tolerate and even brush aside conflict, he is reluctant to actively foment it. \"In a time of crisis, we can't afford to govern out of anger,\" he declared in February 2009. During his campaign and his first year in office, he held to a blind faith in bipartisanship, even as the Republicans voted as a bloc against his legislation. He is, perhaps, ill-suited in these respects for an era of bruising political warfare. His advisers have clearly reinforced these inclinations. In the campaign, they fashioned him as the outsider candidate of \"hope\" and \"change\" and have extended this strategy into the presidency itself. They see him as standing above party. In a meeting with congressional leaders last April, senior adviser David Axelrod rejected the complaint that Obama accorded equal blame to Democrats and Republicans with his descriptions of the \"cynical politics in Washington.\" Within the White House, top aides still speak of promoting the Obama \"brand.\" Organizing for America, the administration's campaign organization, which is supposed to be focusing on the 2010 elections, recently devoted its resources to organizing parties across the country to celebrate Obama's forty-ninth birthday. These efforts to elevate Obama above the hurly-burly of Washington politics have been disastrous. Obama's image as an iconic outsider has become the screen on which Fox News, the Tea Party, radicalright bloggers, and assorted politicians have projected the image of him as a foreigner, an Islamic radical, and a socialist. He has remained \"the other\" that he aspired to be during the campaign, but he and his advisers no longer control how that otherness is defined. The White House and cabinet officials he appointed have reinforced his aversion to populism. As Jonathan Alter recounts in The Promise: President Obama, Year One, Geithner and Summers repeatedly blocked attempts to get tough on Wall Street on the grounds that doing so would threaten the recovery itself by upsetting the bankers. For most of his first year, Alter writes, \"Obama bought the Geithner-Summers argument that the banks were fragile and couldn't be confronted while they remained in peril.\" Its reluctance to come down on the bankers crippled the administration politically, making it far more difficult for it to get its way with Congress on a second stimulus program that would have boosted the recovery and Democrats' political prospects. Bad politics can trump good policy. Populism has profound shortcomings as a worldview. It tends toward demagoguery. In its relentless focus on the middle class, it can ignore or stigmatize those below it. It can prove hostile to a long-range scientific outlook. A more populist Obama, for instance, might have postponed the battle for climate change legislation or national health insurance and probably would have taken a weaker stand on immigration. But populism has been an indelible part of the American political psyche, and those who are uncomfortable making populist appeals, like Hoover or Carter—or, more recently, presidential candidate John Kerry—suffer the consequences at the polls. If Obama's politics leads to a Republican takeover of one or both houses of Congress, and even to a Republican president in 2012, then much of what Obama has accomplished could be undone. It's unlikely that a new Republican president and Congress would actually repeal the health care or the financial reform bill. But the former could be starved of public funds and deprived of regulatory oversight; and the latter could be neutered by a hostile treasury secretary and by weak or hostile presidential appointees to the Securities and Exchange Commission or the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency. Reform legislation needs administrations and congresses committed to reform. That is where politics has to come in; and that's where the Obama administration, with its aversion to populism, has fallen short. John B.

In the last month, North Korea has posted a series of video clips on YouTube brimming with satire and vitriol against leaders in South Korea and the United States. In one clip, it called Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton a \"minister in a skirt\" and Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates a \"war maniac,\" while depicting the South Korean defense minister, Kim Tae-young, as a \"servile dog\" that likes to be patted by \"its American master.\" Such language used to be standard in North Korea's cold-war-era propaganda. Its revival is testimony to the increased chill in relations between the Koreas in recent months. In the past week, North Korea also began operating a Twitter account under the name uriminzok, or \"our nation.\" Both the Twitter and YouTube accounts are owned by a user named \"uriminzokkiri.\" The Web site www.uriminzokkiri.com is run by the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea, a propaganda agency in Pyongyang. Lee Jong-joo, a spokeswoman for the Unification Ministry in Seoul, said, \"It is clear that these accounts carry the same propaganda as the North's official news media, but we have not been able to find out who operates them.\" The two Koreas agreed to stop their psychological war after their first summit meeting in 2000. But South Korea resumed propaganda radio broadcasts in May, when it accused the North of torpedoing one of its warships, killing 46 sailors. North Korea, which denies involvement, has vowed to retaliate. It appears to have found a way with Twitter and YouTube, with their intended audience clearly South Koreans. (North Korea keeps its people isolated from the outside world.) \"YouTube and Twitter gave North Korea a high-tech detour for its propaganda,\" said Paik Hak-soon, an analyst at Sjong Institute. \"But fundamentally, it's not new technology but rather political tension that drives the North to lash out desperately in the face of mounting international pressure.\" During the cold war era, South Korea punished people caught listening to North Korean broadcasts. Several years ago, during the brief era of its \"sunshine policy\" of engaging the North, the South allowed its people access to North Korean Web sites. But today, when a computer user in South Korea clicks on an item on the North Korean Twitter account, a government warning against \"illegal content\" pops up. These blocks have triggered criticism here that the Seoul government does not trust its people to form their own opinions about the totalitarian North. But the government says the North is using the Internet to spread conspiracy theories about who was behind the sinking of the South Korean warship, including one claim that an American submarine did so to foster a militant mood in the South. The Twitter account, which provides links to the North Korean Web site, had 928 followers as of Monday. But a few YouTube video clips uploaded by the North commanded thousands of views. In one such clip, North Korea attacked Yu Myung-hwan, the South Korean foreign minister, who recently criticized \"pro- North Korean youths\" who voted for the opposition in the June local elections, saying, \"If they like the North so much, they should go and live under Kim Jong-il.\" The clip's narrator calls Mr. Yu a \"pro-American flunky\" and advised Mr. Yu to earn a living \"mopping the floor of the Pentagon.\" Another clip claimed that North Korea would prevail in a war with the \"American imperialists\" because it was armed with nuclear-fusion technology; because of its juche, or ideology of \"self-reliance\"; and because of a philosophical treatise written by Kim II-sung, the North's founding president and the father of Kim Jong-il, who died in 1994. \"I don't think this propaganda from the North will have any significant impact among South Koreans,\" said Yoo Ho-yeol, an expert on North Korea at Korea University here. \"People watch this for fun, not to be influenced.\""

"C05771218"	"Hurricane Tomas in route to Haiti to hit 4 Nov right now on southern claw. SouthCom's announcement: USS IWO JIMA DEPLOYS TO HAITI AS TROPICAL STORM APPROACHES MIAMI - U.S. Southern Command directed the amphibious ship USS Iwo Jima (LHD 7) to steam toward Haiti today in preparation for the forecasted arrival of tropical storm Tomas later this week. Iwo Jima will deploy to Haiti from Suriname, where it arrived Thursday on its final country visit for Continuing Promise 2010, a four-month, humanitarian civic assistance deployment to eight nations in the Caribbean region. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Haiti later this week. Large amphibious ships, like Iwo Jima, resemble small aircraft carriers and include the ability to support helicopter and landing craft operations to quickly move personnel and cargo, making it an ideal platform to support humanitarian-relief missions on short notice. A crew of 1,600 military and civilian medical, engineering, aviation, logistical and other support personnel are embarked aboard Iwo Jima, including U.S. Navy engineers, a contingent of 500 Marines with logistical-support expertise, volunteers from the U.S. Public Health Service and various non-governmental organizations (NG0s), as well as medical, dental and engineering professionals from Europe, North America and South America. Eight CH-46 Sea Knight, medium-lift, dual-rotor helicopters; two MH-60 Knight Hawk helicopters and two amphibious landing craft units (ICU's) are on Iwo Jima to support the ship's operations. Iwo Jima is a Wasp-class amphibious ship capable of speeds in excess of 20 knots that can provide robust ship-to-shore, as well as shore-to-shore logistics support during contingencies ranging from traditional military operations to humanitarian and disaster-relief missions. Because of the Caribbean region's history of severe-weather events during the peak months of the hurricane season, the ship has remained in the area throughout its present deployment, ready to support U.S. disaster relief efforts when directed. Iwo Jima was in Port-de-Paix, Haiti, from July 24 through Aug. 3. It was the first stop on CP10 and the crew provided medical assistance to more than 4,000 Haitian citizens, performed 32 surgeries, completed six engineering projects, and delivered 231 pallets of humanitarian-assistance supplies donated by NG0s. In September 2008, the amphibious ship USS Kearsarge deployed to Haiti to support U.S. relief efforts after a succession of storms (Fay, Gustav, Hanna and Ike) devastated the country. Kearsarge provided robust air and sealift support, delivering 3.3 million pounds of food, water and other aid to communities impacted by the disasters. ### Related links: About Continuing Promise 2010: http://www.southcom.mil/AppsSC/factFiles.php?id=155 Photo of USS Iwo Jima: http://www.southcom.mil/AppsSC/images/uploads/634159131775283089.jpg CLASSIFICAT1ON:UNCLASSIFIED"

Sid http://www.newsweek.com/2010/04/15/europe-s-new-politics-of-fear.print.html Europe's New Politics of Fear by Denis MacShaneApril 16, 2010 There is a new divide in Europe. Not an iron curtain, but an iron intolerance as politicians revert to blaming minorities for their nations' woes. In Western Europe it is Muslims. In Eastern Europe they are Jews, Roma, and gays. In the Netherlands, Geert Wilders surged to an election victory in March on the back of anti-Muslim, anti-Quran populism. In Hungary the Fidesz Party won big in recent elections with attacks on \"Jewish capital... which wants to devour the entire world.\" To the right of Fidesz is the openly anti-Jewish Jobbik Party, which won just two seats fewer than the Socialists. Its leaders want to wear the neo-Nazi uniform of the pre-1939 Hungarian Guard when they take their seats in Budapest's Parliament. Contemporary political scientists do not like to highlight anti-Semitism. They prefer the term \"radical populism,\" but to anyone with half a sense of European history, the parallels with an older, Jew-baiting politics can no longer be dismissed. Economic dislocation and a rapid loss of confidence in traditional politics gave rise to ultranationalist movements in the first half of the last century. Now a global recession and the hunt for someone to blame as jobs and incomes disappear is producing the same toxic politics. The Fidesz leader, Viktor Orban, was a youthful evangelist for liberalized open markets after 1990. Now he strikes a much more nationalist tone. His Socialist opponents had to accept an austerity IMF package. Unlike Greece—which is being helped, so far, by its euro-zone partners—Hungary was alone as boom-time euro loans to buy houses and cars had to be paid back in an ever-devaluing forint. Blaming the Socialist government, globalization, and international capital was easy. But Fidesz went further. In a bid for votes on the far right, a Fidesz parliamentarian, Oszkar Molnar, says it's time to give \"primacy to Hungarian interests over those of global capital, Jewish capital.\" Like Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front in France, Jobbik has the support of about 15 percent of Hungarian voters. The Czech right-wing ODS Party has had to dismiss its leader, former premier Mirek Topolanek, after he attacked the Jewish origins of the current Czech prime minister and castigated the gay transport minister. In a new book, The Populist Radical Right in Poland, the Oxford-educated Warsaw political professor Rafal Pankowski writes: \"Antisemitism is crucial to the Polish populist right. The number of Jews in Poland today is minimal, but the anti-Jewish prejudice serves as a code for a general hostility to diversity and to Polish [liberal] democracy.\" For the time being, criticism of nationalist politics is suspended as Poles mourn President Lech Kaczynski and other national leaders killed in the air-crash tragedy this month. But the record of his party activists—including Michal Kaminski, Poland's best-known M.E.P. and leader of a small right- wing group in the Strasbourg Parliament—is disturbing. An admirer of the late Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, Kaminski uses ugly language about gays, and says he will apologize for the killing of Jews on Polish soil in World War II when \"Jews apologize for killing Poles.\" Mainstream political parties have sought to play down the rise of minority bashing. But Fidesz is affiliated with the center- right European People's Party, which groups Angela Merkel's ruling Christian Democratic Union Party in Germany, Nicolas Sarkozy's Union for a Popular Movement government in France, and ruling conservative parties in Sweden, Italy, and Belgium. When Austrian rightist Jorg Haider entered a coalition in Austria a decade ago, the European Union held Vienna in a political quarantine until Haider was removed. But Fidesz has a massive majority built on attacking \"Jewish capital\" in language even Haider didn't dare utter. So radical populism—anti-Muslim in Western Europe, anti-Jewish in Eastern Europe, and anti-foreigner and anti- immigrant rhetoric everywhere—is no longer fringe politics. In Britain's general election, all the main parties are seeking to appease anti-foreigner feeling with language on immigrants that they would not tolerate if applied to British citizens living and working abroad. Comparisons with prewar Europe should not be overdrawn. Fascism is dead and not coming back. But a new politics of intolerance is afoot in Europe, and no one knows how to deal with it. http://www.newsweek.com/2010/09/05/how-marine-le-pen-is-changing-french-politics.print.html B6 Eit What a Tea Party Looks Like in Europe Marine Le Pen is moving her father's rabble-rousing, far-right party away from the fringe, and redefining French politics in the process. by Tracy McNicoll and Christopher DickeySeptember 05, 2010 amuel Bollendorff / The New York Times-Redux Marine Le Pen is the heir apparent to the leadership of the National Front, the right-wing party her father Jean-Marie (left) leads today Jean-Marie Le Pen, the 82-year-old firebrand of France's far right—the man who for decades has played on the inchoate fears, xenophobia, knee-jerk racism, and ill-disguised anti-Semitism of many of his supporters—had just finished speaking to the faithful on a farm not far from the English Channel. As members of the youth wing of his National Front party feasted on barbecue and apple pie, they were thrilled to see the grand old man hold forth, still the \"provocateur\" taunting the establishment, the \"toreador\" who hides the sword in his cape and lets the press run at him like a bull. Even these youngsters knew, however, that Jean-Marie's time in the ring is nearing an end. The old man himself made it clear he's. determined to step down. All eyes this day were on his daughter Marine. \"She has the will, the courage, the temperament necessary, and the competence,\" Le Pen told reporters at the farmhouse. \"It seems to me indisputable that she is our camp's best candidate for 2012.\" Tall, blonde, plain-spoken, and thick-skinned, Le Pen's youngest child, at 42, is the heir apparent to his party. She's expected to win the contest for its leadership in January, and she's a passionate advocate of its core message: strong French nationalism, relentless Euro-skepticism, and a lot of hard-nosed talk about fighting crime and immigration. She's a fresh face, a new look, and, with rising poll numbers placing her third in a crowded field of possible 2012 candidates, a new threat in French politics. In the eyes of many, she's more effective—and thus more dangerous—than her father. It's a measure of the Le Pens' enhanced power that they've managed to push President Nicolas Sarkozy to the right and cast their own party as mainstream. Over the summer, Sarkozy essentially gave up his flirtation with the left, which began after his election in 2007. He had cherry-picked popular Socialists for his centrist government, dividing their party. But in elections this past March, Sarkozy's UMP party managed to keep control of only one out of 22 regional governments. So he decided to swing back to the right by playing on fears about public safety and immigration. He proposed taking citizenship away from some criminals of immigrant background and launched a campaign against Roma (or \"Gypsies\"), booting hundreds out of the country. While the measures proved popular in opinion polls, Sarkozy, ironically, did not. His abysmal approval ratings remain in the low 30s. The younger Le Pen takes great pleasure in watching Sarkozy squirm. \"I think I get on [his] nerves quite a bit,\" she says. \"My profile is much more complicated for him to deal with than that of my father.\" The old man could be painted as a creature of the past, a purveyor of old prejudices with a \"sulfurous\" reputation, says Marine. Today, however, the Front wants to bill itself as \"neither left nor right.\" If that means losing some fringe elements (many of whom support Marine's rival, Bruno Gollnisch), well, \"tent pis,\" she says. Other right-wing movements in Europe are also pushing into the political mainstream. The government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in Italy has long relied on its alliance with two groups that used to be considered extreme—one of them the former Fascist Party under Gianfranco Fini, the other the secessionist Northern League of Umberto Bossi. A falling-out between Berlusconi and Fini has left Bossi as the current kingmaker in Italian politics. In the Netherlands, the militantly Islamophobic Geert Wilders won enough seats in the last elections to become a pivotal figure in the drawn-out process of trying to build a new coalition government. Yet these movements often differ in significant ways from the right wing that's made in the U.S.A. Put aside the usual caricature of \"people in pointy hoods and the Ku Klux Klan,\" Marine Le Pen says, and she still believes \"the American right is much more to the right than the National Front.\" She might agree with those who want to manage American frontiers more effectively and prevent massive illegal immigration, but she's also a big believer in the state's ability and obligation to help its people. \"We feel the state should have the means to intervene,\" she says. \"We are very attached to public services A la frangaise as a way to limit the inequalities among regions and among the French,\" including \"access for all to the same level of health care.\" Le Pen grew up in a household that was all politics all the time, with her father the object of sometimes violent attacks by competing factions on the right, as well as by the left. When Marine was just 8, someone set off a 20-kilo bomb in the family's Paris apartment building. Miraculously, no one was killed or seriously injured, but the front of the building was brought down. The crime has never been solved. \"The worst part wasn't just the attack, it was that not a single politician sent a word of condolence,\" she says. \"It was difficult, but it builds character, it hardens you.\" That's a real asset in political life anywhere. If Sarkozy finds himself facing off against Marine Le Pen in the presidential race a year and a half from now, he may find himself wishing her old man had stayed around a little longer.

Michele Flournoy and I also tied for no. 74 on the basis of our respective roles in the QDR and other reviews at DoD and the QDDR here at State. Here are the write ups 13. Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton for proving that you don't need to be president to act presidential. FORMER PRESIDENT I NEW YORK SECRETARY OF STATE I WASHINGTON Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in September, Hillary Rodham Clinton sounded a confident note: \"After years of war and uncertainty, people are wondering what the future holds, at home and abroad. So let me say it clearly: The United States can, must, and will lead in this new century.\" Ironically, two of the people most crucial to the new global century are the Clintons themselves: the ex-president and the ex-would-be-president, the power couple now defined by their position just outside the highest reaches of power. Except that, these days, both Clintons are more influential, and more beloved, than ever. Bill's Clinton Global Initiative is starting to feel like a sexier, more effective competitor not just to Davos but to the United Nations itself, bringing world leaders together to commit their resources to fighting poverty with market-based, technocratic solutions. As of this summer, his foundation had contributed $23 million and countless man-hours to the effort to rebuild Haiti. Polls have shown he's a better advocate for Democratic candidates than the actual president, and he spent most of the fall stumping for woebegone Dems from Orlando to Seattle. Meanwhile, Hillary showed up in one recent poll as the most popular political figure in the United States, an accolade she has earned through a no-drama approach to an array of thankless tasks: brushing off Vladimir Putin's temper tantrum to reach agreement on nuclear disarmament and Iran sanctions, promoting women's rights over the objections of entrenched traditionalists, and launching an innovative effort to bring clean cookstoves to the world's poorest. But what she has mainly stood for is American competence, with her Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review a major, if unglamorous step toward making U.S. statesmanship a more agile beast. If this is what Clinton nostalgia looks like, bring it on. 74. Michele Flournoy and Anne-Marie Slaughter for setting the tone of how the United States engages with the world. POLICY PLANNING CHIEFS, DEFENSE AND STATE DEPARTMENTS I WASHINGTON Barack Obama campaigned in 2008 on the promise of changing not just the style but the substance of how the United States deals with its allies and enemies abroad, and the job of figuring out how to enact the changes fell largely to two people in particular. At the State Department, Anne-Marie Slaughter, director of policy planning, is spearheading the department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. The review aims to rejuvenate marginalized civilian agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development, preparing for a world in which America's worst threats are not great-power rivals but the upheavals associated with failed and failing states. Slaughter's Pentagon counterpart is Undersecretary for Policy Michele Flournoy, co-founder of the Center for a New American Security think tank, who articulated a vision for a new Democratic realism in foreign policy that both candidates Hillary Clinton and Obama embraced in the 2008 election. In 2010 she oversaw the Pentagon's own quadrennial review, a blueprint that cuts back on big-ticket weapons systems and focuses instead on the immediate needs posed by today's asymmetrical conflicts. Flournoy has also been a vocal advocate for Obama's Afghanistan strategy, albeit a pragmatic one: \"I don't want to suggest that achieving success will be simple or easy,\" she told the Senate in February. \"We need to prepare for the possibility that things may get harder before they get better.\" Anne-Marie Slaughter Director of Policy Planning U.S. Dept(silent of State (202) 647-2972"
"C05772036"	"Verma, Richard R <VermaRR@state.gov> Friday, November 5, 2010 6:05 AM H; Lew, Jacob J; Mills, Cheryl D FW: The Cable: Granger seeking chairmanship of State and foreign ops subcommittee The Cable: Granger seeking chairmanship of State and foreign ops subcommittee Granger seeking chairmanship of State and foreign ops subcommittee Posted: 03 NOV 2010 1131 AM PDT Texas Congresswoman Kay Granger will seek the chairmanship of the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, according to her spokesman, ending rumors that she would forgo the post in favor of some other position. Although no decisions have been made, until last night Granger was the ranking Republican on the panel and she is the clear frontrunner for the job. She would succeed current chairwoman Nita Lowey(D-NY), who has served as chairwoman since 2006. \"Congresswoman Granger is interested in continuing on as chair of the state and foreign operations appropriations subcommittee,\" Matt LeffingwelL her press secretary, toldThe Cable Wednesday. When power switches in Congress, a complicated game of musical chairs begins as senior members jockey for committee and subcommittee chairs. Just being the highest-ranking minority member on a panel doesn't mean one automatically takes over the chairmanship. But if Granger does succeed Lowey, she will play a large role in writing the bills that appropriate money for State Department operations, USAID, foreign operations, foreign assistance, humanitarian assistance, and many other things. Those accounts all face unprecedented pressure next year as the GOP led Congress will be looking for spending cuts that don't have strong domestic constituencies. Last month, we identified Granger as one of 10 Republicans who stand to be influential in the next Congress if the GOP won control of the House. Since then, we've received several e-mails from sources who had heard that Granger would forgo the subcommittee chairmanship to pursue leadership of another panel. We've heard that Ander Crenshaw (R-FL), the third-ranking Republican on the panel, was eyeing the chairmanship with the expectation that Granger would step aside. (Mark Kirk (R-IL), the second-ranking Republican on the subcommittee, was elected Tuesday night to become the junior senator from Illinois, the seat once held by Barack Obama.) So how would subcommittee chairwoman Granger handle the responsibility of writing the State and foreign ops appropriations bill? Here's what we reported in October: Although [Granger] supported the bill put forth this year by current chairwoman Nita Lowey CD-N.Y.), she criticizedthe increases for the foreign-ops budget, saying, \"We also face the continued concern in our own country about our economy and the devastating effects of skyrocketing deficits and debt.\" She's a strong supporter of a balanced budget amendment, which doesn't bode well for foreign-aid funding in this dismal fiscal environment. Granger also serves on the defense subcommittee, placing her at the intersection of the debate over how to balance the national security budget and shift resources from defense to diplomacy and development. Here she seems to favor the Pentagon, saying in June, \"I want to be sure that we aren't increasing foreign aid at the expense of our troops.\" Her lack of support of international organizations was criticized by the group Citizens for Global Solutions, which gave her an \"F\" in its 2007to 2009 rating. Granger is also on board with efforts to eliminate aid to countries that are not performing on internal reform, as she explained when expressing opposition to funding of the Senegalese government through the State Department's Millennium Challenge Corporation. \"We can't just give out money and say we will put up with whatever you are doing,\" she said. The committee leadership assignments won't be doled out for at least two to three weeks, our Hill sources report. But if Granger's bid is successful, she'll be instantly influential. The fiscal 2011 State and Foreign Ops bill still has not been completed by Congress, despite that the fiscal year began Oct. 1. The stop gap funding measure that has been funding these programs since then, known as a \"continuing resolution,\" expires in December. The lame duck Democratic led Congress is unlikely to be able to pass full appropriations bills on its way out the door, so they will likely pass another short term continuing resolution. That would leave the final work on the actual bill to the incoming class led by the GOP next year.

Sid raw Westen Psychologist and neuroscientist; Emory University Professor Posted: October 8, 2010 09:23 AM dJnLM L t , -. -1.117.=1MIC2VAILISIrie ll=a===.1 According to news reports, today Republican minority leader and Coppertone model John Boehner will give his \"closing argument\" to the American people on why they should throw out the Democrats and kill the Obama-Pelosi-Reid \"job- killing agenda.\" He will be returning to his working class roots, speaking at a piping manufacturing plant, an unusual venue these days for a man who is seen much more frequently at gatherings of Wall Street executives with open checkbooks and the males-only country club where he works on his tan when not making the rounds at other clubs with industry lobbyists. Either the Speaker-to-be is following the model of Michael Steele and free-lancing, or Karl Rove and the Republicans believe it is safe or even advantageous to bring him out in public after the White House made an effort to put Boehner's face on what a Republican majority might look like, with the president invoking his name eight times in one speech. I have to admit that at the time I was agnostic as to whether it made sense to try to brand him at this late date, as Boehner has minimal name recognition among voters. But the White House was no doubt responding to three realities. First, Boehner is an unknown to most Americans, which means that, unlike most Republicans in the news, he has not been well branded by the GOP -- which means for once Democrats might actually brand someone or something first rather than playing catch-up. Second, Boehner would indeed be the highest-ranking Republican were the GOP to assume control over the House (other than of course Karl Rove, who is now directing traffic on the right side of the street in Washington again). And third, a concrete face is always better than an abstraction when telling a story, and other than perhaps Sarah Palin, who Republicans could alternately accept and decline as the leader of their party, Boehner's tanned visage and history as errand-boy for virtually every major corporate special interest in his two decades in Washington (including his stint as the Marlboro Man, handing out tobacco lobby campaign checks to his fellow Republicans on the floor of the House) made him a potential counter-villain to the Republican's bogeywoman, Nancy Pelosi. I remained agnostic until this week, when colleagues at Media Matters Action Network and I conducted a national 5urye:y with 1,000 registered voters, selected to match the demographics of the voting and likely voting populations. The goal was to see how effectively we could speak with voters about Boehner as not only the symbol and standard-bearer for the GOP but also the water-boy for corporate America. (The results were surprisingly similar whether we looked at registered voters or likely voters, although as others have described, precisely how to determine who is a \"likely voter\" in this election is as much art as science, and the point of good messaging at this point is actually to change the dynamics of likely voting, not just to reflect them.) As detailed in a memo published in Politico, what we found was clear: Boehner is a target well worth defining, who readily stands for precisely what Americans perceive to be the reasons they would have to hold their noses to vote for Congressional Republicans (perhaps the only group left who poll worse than Congressional Democrats with swing voters). We tested both paragraph-length narratives and single-sentence language designed to capture the essence of those narratives, and in each case, we tested them against the toughest opposition language we could test them against: the words of Boehner, Cantor, Limbaugh and others combined in defining the \"Obama-Pelosi-Reid\" agenda. What we found, in brief: is that we could beat a tough GOP narrative about the \"job-killing\" socialists in the White House and Congress by 15 to 20 points with two narratives starring Boehner in the leading role (with best supporting bad actor going in one of the narratives to Karl Rove and his corporate allies), and we could win with over 15 different sentence-long descriptions of \"what's the matter with Boehner\" with margins ranging from 10 to 60 points against a tough conservative attack on the Obama-Pelosi-Reid axis of conservative evil. The narratives that most moved likely voters -- including swing voters, who preferred them by double-digits over tough Republican rhetoric -- made clear whose voices Boehner would be speaking for as Speaker (e.g., the Wall Street executives he convened to try to block Wall Street reform). They harnessed the same populist anger at the hijacking of Washington by corporate special interests that has enlivened the tea partiers and is palpable across the political spectrum, and they focused on the extremism of the party Boehner would Speak for. A narrative that brought Karl Rove into the picture was slightly more polarizing with swing voters but slightly more powerful with likely Democratic voters. In some ways what was most surprising was the success of the single-line statements of what we need in a Speaker and who John Boehner really speaks for (although these single-line statements came after the narratives, and likely reflect the power of branding, even over the course of a brief online encounter with voters). They ranged from relatively lofty and aspirational (e.g., \"We need a Speaker who is also a listener, who can hear the voices of ordinary Americans\" -- a theme colleagues and I found highly resonant across the political spectrum in message testing on the role of money in politics) -- to the harder-edged (e.g., \"The Speaker of the House is a heartbeat away from the Presidency. Unfortunately, we know where John Boehner's heart is, and it isn't with the middle class,\" or \"John Boehner understands deficits. He's spent nearly 20 years in Washington creating them.\") If there's a message in this message research, it is at once short-term and long-term. In the short run, if Democrats want to hang onto their seats in November, they would do well to define this election in terms of the middle class and small business versus the billionaires and big corporations that are hijacking our democracy; to use Boehner as a poster child for the party whose primary commitment is to the latter and whose tan is a testament to that commitment; and to avoid giving voters reason to regret their vote if they give it to Democrats again this time, by supporting the things they say they stand for and avoiding that golden mean between the public interest and the special interests that finance campaigns on both sides of the aisle. In the longer run, branding matters. One of the biggest strategic and messaging mistakes of the last two years was the failure of Democrats to brand their opponents while their opponents were busy branding them -- and in particular the failure to brand the Bush Recession as the natural consequence of faded Republican economic principles. Two years ago, that was a virtually uncontested political proposition, as the voters made clear in handing Democrats the White House and supermajorities in both the House and Senate. Today, the public is split down the middle as to who caused the recession. Reality doesn't brand itself. Hopefully it won't take a debacle in November and another 10 million jobs lost for reality to unveil itself again for a brief political moment and for progressives to have a second bite at the apple."

"C05775479"	"Pinstripes to cargo pants -- Clinton tailors new vision for diplomacy By Elise Labatt, CNN October 27, 2010 12:51 p.m. EDT STORY HIGHLIGHTS • It is the first-ever undertaking for the State Department • Approach will focus on American leadership through civilian power • Going forward, diplomats likely to wear cargo pants as a pinstriped suit. Washington (CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is outlining how she plans to redefine U.S. diplomacy and development ahead of a top-down review which has taken place this year and will be released in the coming weeks. In an essay in the November/December issue of Foreign Affairs, Clinton previews the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, commonly referred to as the QDDR. The review, the first-ever such an undertaking for the State Department, is meant to balance a similar quadrennial review by the Defense Department that projects their strategy and priorities. The new approach to development, Clinton says, will focus on American leadership through civilian power. Both Clinton and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and have talked about \"demilitarizing\" foreign policy, and Clinton says the QDDR will suggest how to do that, with a whole new set of resources for diplomacy and development, much of which will be geared toward fragile states in conflict or crisis. In the article, Clinton painted the broad strokes of the document, which she called a blueprint for reforms to be implemented over the next four years. Those reforms include modernizing and coordinating diplomacy across U.S. government agencies, creating a stronger nexus between diplomacy and development and ensuring that development undertaken by the U.S. has a lasting and \"sustainable\" impact. \"Economic growth is the surest route out of poverty, and expanding and strengthening middle classes around the world will be key to creating the just and sustainable international order that lies at the heart of the United States' national security strategy,\" Clinton wrote in Foreign Affairs. She said that the U.S. ultimate goal in development was to \"put itself out of business\" by boosting up countries to assume responsibility for their own projects and future. President Barack Obama laid out the vision and the basic pillars of the policy in September at the United Nations General Assembly when he released the \"U.S. Global Development Policy,\" which changes U.S. efforts to focus on building up countries that demonstrate good governance and economic potential. But the QDDR will outline how to put that policy into practice. Officials say the 150-page document will detail everything from how the United States conducts multilateral diplomacy, how the United States undertakes \"stabilization\" efforts in post-conflict areas, how the State Department works with USAID and contractors to the types and numbers of personnel needed to implement the new approach. American diplomats going forward, Clinton said, are as likely to wear cargo pants as a pinstriped suit."

Support for Arms Treaty By PETER BAKER Another Republican senator signaled Tuesday that he may vote for the new arms control treaty with Russia if it comes up for a vote before the Senate adjourns for the year later this month. Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who did not run for re-election, said he hopes that the Senate will get a chance to vote on the treaty, known as New Start, right after a deal on tax cuts and a spending resolution to keep the government operating. \"Start is an important issue. It should be fully debated. I am leaning towards supporting it,\" he told Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC. \"I haven't made a final decision,\" he added, noting that Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the lead Republican negotiator on the treaty, still has concerns. \"He has some reservations, but I believe many of those reservations are being addressed,\" Mr. Gregg said. President Obama has made passing the treaty his top foreign policy priority for the lame-duck session. Under the Constitution, approving a treaty requires a two-thirds super-majority, or 67 votes, meaning that Mr. Obama needs nine Republicans assuming all 58 Democrats stick with him. At this point, more than that many Republicans have offered positive-sounding statements like that made on Tuesday"
"C05777937"	"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/dec/23/bitter-new-washington/ The New York Review of Books In the Bitter New Washington December 23, 2010 • ;izaibeth O w Of course Obama should have gotten out of Washington more and listened to people, not just talked at them; and, as Walter Mondale said recently, he should have gotten rid of \"those idiot boards\"—the TelePrompters on which the great orator has been strangely dependent and which divide him from his audiences. Last year, a friend of mine was invited to a Hanukkah party that the Obamas gave for prominent Jews (a group with whom there had been tensions), and after the Obamas descended the grand stairway, they stood in the foyer briefly; the President made a few remarks and shook a few hands, and back up the stairs they went. No mingling. In their first two years, the Obamas have seemed a bit tone-deaf: there were too many vacations while people were hurting, especially Michelle's extravagant trip to Spain. (I'm as interested in Michelle's clothes as the next woman but at the same time think she and her staff are too focused on her looking smashing, which she does. Her wardrobe seems quite extensive for these troubled times.) Barack Obama's personality has been much mulled over in the past two years, but it seems inescapable that his high self- esteem often slides over the thin line to arrogance, which trickles down (with some exceptions) to much of his staff, some of whom are downright rude to all but a chosen few. °barna has seemed uninterested in anyone but his immediate group, and three of the four members of his immediate circle--Jarrett, Robert Gibbs, David Axelrod—had had no experience in governing. The fourth, Rahm Emanuel, expressed himself with such flippancy, arrogance, and overuse of the F-word that he offended not just members of Congress but also would-be allies of the President. Vice President Joe Bider), who is liked on Capitol Hill, was virtually shut out of the dealings with people in Congress in the first two years—\"I can handle them,\" Obama told Biden—but Biden is now expected to be given a larger role as part of the White House's new determination to \"reach out.\" (A few months ago highly placed members of the staff also swore they would \"reach out,\" but that seemed to last for just a few days.) One of the oddest aspects of Obama's persona is that someone who seems so confident has insisted thus far in having people around him with whom he is said to be \"comfortable.\" For example, Torn Donilon, his recently appointed national security adviser (a promotion from his role as deputy), is by all accounts a capable man but is no one's idea of a serious strategic thinker. The explanation I was given for Donilon's being given his new position was that \"the President is comfortable with him.\" Just as Obama is described as pleased with himself, he has been treated with hero worship by much of his staff. After all, he had taken on the formidable Clintons, and, against the expectation of almost all the pundits and the experts, he had beaten them. Why should he listen to those who had doubted him? A common complaint about the Obama White House in the first two years has been that there were no \"grown-ups\" around, people who knew more about governing and who would tell Obama that he was wrong. When people tried to suggest someone who should be brought in, that person was rejected as \"not one of ours.\" Joe Biden is said to argue with Obama on issues, such as Afghanistan, but not to get into the management of the White House.... Those who supported Obama in 2008 expected him to be able to move public opinion, to get people to follow him. The fact that the Obama White House has been so poor at \"messaging\" baffles even his strongest supporters. In fact, he had no overall message. As Winston Churchill put it, there was no theme to his pudding. When I asked a White House aide about this, he pointed to what had been billed as a \"major speech on the economy,\" at Georgetown University in April 2009. But the speech was utterly forgettable—and forgotten. One ally attributes this problem to the inexperience of both Obama and his top staff. An ally says, \"You can't leave a message if you don't have a strategy and you don't know where you're going.\" Another says, \"They had something that worked in the campaign but didn't work in the White House.\" Thus, Obama didn't see the need to explain what he was doing. His 2010 campaign themes seemed to wander all over the place: Stanley Greenberg, a pollster and former aide to Bill Clinton, said that Obama's oft-used theme, that we shouldn't go back to the Bush days, actually tested negatively, because people didn't believe that the country was making economic, progress. So Obama's biggest failure was not to be the leader that so many expected him to be. The jubilation that surrounded his swearing-in may have gone to his head, while the celebrants overlooked that there were plenty of people out there who were not overjoyed at the advent of a black president, or even a Democrat. Obama was, apparently in his own estimation, so smart and so adored that he seems to have felt no need to explain—and explain again—to the country what he was doing and to take the country along with him. This failure to put his programs across came up a few times in the 2010 campaign.... More than once, people in town hall meetings told him that they were behind him but were having great trouble trying to defend or explain his agenda. In a backyard gathering on October 21 he made the most awkward reply of those I heard: \"Our attitude was that we just had to get the policies right and we didn't always think about making sure we got the advertising properly about what was going on.\" Advertising. (When I mentioned this to a Democratic senator who was generally supportive of Obama, this ordinarily polite man responded, \"Bullocks! What policies?\") The risk-averse Obama had left it to Congress to write the big bills such as on the economic stimulus and health care (with strong participation by White House aides). But he kept up this line of defense all the way through to his pathetic press conference on the day after the election. In these comments, Obama gave away the devastating fact that he didn't really understand the role of the president as leader. A friend of the Obama administration said to me, \"Their definition of governing is passing bills.\" Someone else relatively close to the White House explained that since Obama had been so criticized for being \"arrogant\" and \"aloof,\" he had to eat large portions of humble pie. (\"And I take responsibility for that,\" Obama said again and again.)"

"C05778447"	"The unsigned editorials will appear in all of Bloomberg's online and print media properties — including Bloomberg Businessweek, Bloomberg.corn and the nearly 300,000 financial data terminals leased to Wall Street traders and businesses around the world. It will be run by two distinguished voices: James P. Rubin, a former assistant secretary of state under Bill Clinton, and David Shipley, editor of The New York Times Op-Ed page. got December 15, 2010 loomberg to Publish Editorials By ,IERE-:EviY PE.TEP.S Being mayor of New York City would be a large enough platform for just about anyone. But apparently not for Michael R. The mayor's company, 3loomber, ,3 L.P., said on Wednesday that it would begin publishing editorials across its vast media enterprise in an effort to broaden the company's influence on national affairs. And though Mr. Bloomberg has an agreement with the city to have no involvement in the \"day-to-day operations\" of his company, the endeavor, called Bloomberg View, is intended to channel his personal philosophy and worldview. \"I think it's very important that everyone understands that our editorial page is going to be, for sure, consistent with the values and beliefs of the founder — even if he happens to be mayor of New York City,\" said Matthew Winkler, the editor in chief of Bloomberg News. \"I fully expect us in our Bloomberg View always to reflect those values. In fact, I want people to come away from reading the Bloomberg View infused with those beliefs and values.\" The effort presents a host of conflict-of-interest questions for the mayor. The new venture provides the mayor with yet another potent communications apparatus — one that carries his name and imprimatur — to sound off on issues that collide with his job as mayor, his corporate interests and his expanding philanthropic empire. Bloomberg L.P. executives said they would not shy away from publishing editorials on issues in which Mr. Bloomberg has a direct interest as mayor, like education, public health and environmental policy. Mr. Winkler said the editorials would not avoid such issues but would disclose the mayor's involvement when warranted. Though Mr. Bloomberg will not have a hand in conceiving and writing the editorials, he is likely to offer feedback from time to time before they are published, Mr. Winkler said. \"I think that there's a very good chance that's going to happen,\" he said, referring to Mr. Bloomberg's occasional involvement. It is unclear whether that level of involvement is permitted under his agreement with the city to remain at arm's length from the company. A spokesman for the mayor, Stu Loeser, said the mayor was allowed limited involvement in his agreement with the city. \"Weighing in from time to time is consistent with his being the majority shareholder of the company he founded,\" he said. As someone whose presidential ambitions are the source of endless speculation, acquiring the platform of an editorial page is certain to draw more attention to Mr. Bloomberg's plans. (On Sunday, Mr. Bloomberg ruled out a run for president.) The unsigned editorials will appear in all of Bloomberg's online and print media properties — including Bloomberg Businessweek, Bloomberg.com and the nearly 300,000 financial data terminals leased to Wall Street traders and businesses around the world. It will be run by two distinguished voices: James P. Rubin, a former assistant secretary of state under Bill Clinton, and David Shipley, editor of The New York Times Op-Ed page. Opinion and commentary have not typically been areas of focus for Bloomberg, with its just-the-facts approach. In fact, the mayor has complained about the corrosive effect of the 24-hour news cycle and overheated political commentary in the blogosphere. But company leaders, including Mr. Bloomberg, who has been aware of the project since it was conceived more than two years ago, saw an opportunity to extend their influence. For a firm that has made no secret of its ambitions to become the most influential media company in the world, starting an editorial operation is the latest effort to propel it beyond its core mission as a financial news service. The notion of media barons using editorials to shape public opinion and policy according to their personal views is an old one in American journalism. William Randolph Hearst, for example, often wrote front-page editorials for his newspapers. Mr. Bloomberg, it would seem, is casting himself in that mold, though there are no plans for him to begin writing signed editorials. For now, he is content letting his trusted deputies speak for him. \"He's accepting and embracing the privilege of a media mogul,\" said David Nasaw, a professor of history at the City University of New York Graduate Center, who wrote a biography of Hearst. \"This is what we all do. We try to persuade the rest of the world we are right. Of course we don't have the vehicles to do so. The rich have the vehicles to do so.\" Mr. Winkler said: \"There's a huge opportunity here for Bloomberg L.P. and Bloomberg News to seize the day, literally seize the day by bringing wisdom to events as they unfold. And one can't always do that with the best result with reporting.\" \"That certainly is a benefit to the founder of the company, the man. But it is also a huge opportunity for Bloomberg, the company, that it should take advantage of,\" Mr. Winkler added. Bloomberg L.P. acquired BusinessWeek last year, giving the 29-year-old company a print product with a long legacy of accomplishment. Bloomberg is in the midst of an expansion in Washington. With a service called Bloomberg Government, an operation that will eventually employ 300 journalists and analysts, the company will sell, for $5,700 a year, information about government services and contracts to lobbyists and others with business interests in the nation's capital."
