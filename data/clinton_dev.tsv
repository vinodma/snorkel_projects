Talks between Pakistan and the US for cooperation on atomic programmes are under way and we want the US to have an agreement with us like the one it had with India on civil nuclear technology,\" Mr Haqqani said at a reception hosted by Punjab Governor Salmaan Taseer on Sunday. He said Pakistan would get 16 latest F-16 aircraft in June. He said although the expectations of Pakistan and the US with each other usually did not fulfil, both were indispensable for each other. \"We have to largely depend upon the US for our defence related matters. \"India is our main concern as it is buying weapons worth $100 billion from five countries, including China, and to balance it our relations with the US are very significant,\" he said and added that India had 5,500 tanks and there was a question against whom they would be used. \"We cannot be assured by statements that India will not wage a war against us.\" Giving a reason as to why Pakistan had to look towards the US for enhancing its military capacity and capability, Mr Haqqani said the European countries did not offer soft terms for buying weapons. \"Ties with the US are important for a secure, stable and prosperous Pakistan.\" Mr Haqqani said Pakistan had also made it clear on the US that it should ensure a strengthened and Islamabad-friendly regime in Kabul before leaving. He said Pakistan had sought drone technology from America. \"On one hand our innocent people are losing their lives while on the other Taliban leaders like Baitullah Mehsud get killed in such attacks,\" he said. Mr Haqqani said the US wanted to strengthen democracy in Pakistan and aid under the Kerry-Lugar Bill had started coming from January. In reply to a question, he said Pakistan's embassy in the US was working on diplomatic and legal aspects in Dr Aafia Siddiqui case and was making efforts for securing her release or transfer of her case to a Pakistani court. SECOND STORY No nuclear deal with Pakistan, says US By Anwar lqbal Monday, 01 Mar, 2010 I 07:15 AM PST I WASHINGTON: The Obama administration has told Pakistan it would not get an atomic power plant or a civilian nuclear deal from the United States. A senior US official, while briefing Indian journalists in Washington, said the United States was working closely with Pakistan to help meet its growing energy needs. \"But nuclear power is not currently part of our discussions,\" and the United States had conveyed its decision to Pakistan, the official said. He said the administration had also told Pakistan that \"there is no way they can get a civilian nuclear deal similar to the one the Obama administration has signed with India\". The lndo-US civilian nuclear deal, the official said, was \"specific to India only and there is no thinking going on in the administration to create a template for it.\""

Please let me know if you would like any further information. Thanks, Mike United States Institute of Peace: Background Proposals for the creation of a government \"peace\" agency stretch as far back as a proposal in 1792 to create a \"Peace Office\" on par with the War Department. Between 1935 and 1976 over 140 bills were introduced in Congress to establish peace-related agencies, departments, bureaus, and committees of Congress. In 1979 Congress established the Commission on Proposals for the National Academy of Peace and Conflict Resolution. In 1981, the Commission — known as the Matsunaga Commission for its head, Senator Spark Matsunaga — recommended the creation of a national peace academy. In 1984, President Reagan signed the United States Institute of Peace Act and the first meeting of USIP's Board of Directors took place in 1986. The USIP Act established \"an independent, nonprofit, national institute to serve the people and the Government through the widest possible range of education and trainings, basic and applied research opportunities, and peace information services on the means to promote international peace and the resolution of conflicts among the nations and peoples of the world without recourse to violence.\" USIP is an independent agency, funded by Congress, which serves as an intersection between those involved in policy research, fieldwork, and practitioners. More than 70 USIP policy experts conduct research on a wide variety of country- specific and cross-cutting functional issues. Some examples of USIP activities include: ® Working in countries such as Iraq, Sudan, Nigeria, Uganda, Pakistan, and Afghanistan to mediate and facilitate dialogue among parties in conflict, promote the rule of law, strengthen civil society and education systems, and educating the public through events, films, and other outreach. O USIP has given out $58 million in grants for over 1,700 peacebuilding projects in 76 countries. ® USIP hosts standing working groups of experts and practitioners on a variety of issues, including Sudan, Syria, Korea, Iran, Iraq, and Haiti. ® USIP has facilitated a number of task forces, including the Iraq Study Group and the recent Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States, chaired by William Perry.

By Sarah Chayes November 15, 2012 The scandal enveloping members of America's adulated top brass is the deepest crisis to hit the military in decades. It is a crisis President Obama did not need — shaming the country and increasing his burden during a major transition on his national security team. And yet, crisis can be a great corrective. Obama should use this one to reverse one of the most dysfunctional elements of U.S. foreign policy over the last decade: an infatuation with military solutions to problems that are fundamentally political. The resignation of former Central Intelligence Agency Director David H. Petraeus after an extramarital affair came to light, together with expected high-level personnel changes at the State Department and other agencies, creates a singular opportunity to embark on the complex process of rebalancing U.S. foreign policy in favor of non-military approaches. When he first came to office, Obama seemed suspicious of Petraeus, who made his reputation under President George W. Bush as the general who transformed the military's approach to the Iraq war. The suspicion was reflected in the fraught National Security Council debate over Afghanistan strategy in 2009. Yet since then, Obama, like so many others, seems to have been seduced by Petraeus. Not by the man but by what the man could offer him. Petraeuss unique political genius over the last decade has been to provide each of two contrasting presidents a military solution to his key national security problems that was tailored to his character. For Bush, obsessed with Iraq and with leaving a mark on the Middle East, Petraeus helped design a grandiose, troop-heavy approach. With the change of administrations, Petraeus soon saw that Obama and his team were different — concerned about the costs of the inherited wars and about the risks of a runaway military. So while Petraeus continued to pay lip-service to counterinsurgency doctrine, he veered away from it in practice.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. the troops in Afghanistan — and even more so at the CIA — was on a type of warfare better suited to this president: targeted, technologically advanced, secretive killing over which the president could exert control. But such an approach, though cheaper in resources and American lives, is still flawed. It is still a military answer to problems that are deeply political in nature and rooted in a complex mix of history, regional and cultural particularism, and the effects of a protracted abuse of power by elites. By shifting to drones and special ops as the instruments of choice to combat militant extremism, the U.S. government remains consumed by the same old questions: How many men and women in uniform, equipped with what kind of hardware, need to employ which tactics to defeat the enemy? What atrophied during the years that two U.S. administrations dwelt obsessively on these questions were all the other tools of U.S. foreign policy, including information-gathering and analysis, diplomacy and economic and legal leverage. Perhaps the gravest consequence has been the knowledge deficit. Both wars were hampered by a devastating lack of situational understanding. In Afghanistan, where I lived and worked for more than eight years, I was stunned by how long it took U.S. officials to realize that tribes were key to Afghan social structure. U.S. officials resisted meeting with ordinary Afghans, dealing instead with members of a self-serving and unpopular government. So, for more than a decade, the U.S. government was operating almost blind. The first way Obama can constructively harness Petraeus downfall is to reorient the CIA toward its core function: intelligence-gathering. Of late, a body-count culture has prevailed at the CIA, exemplified by the secretive drone campaign. If 60 intelligence professionals are assigned to planning and monitoring each drone in the air, as has been reported, that's 60 who are not on the ground in country, interacting with locals, gaining an intuitive feel for the dynamics. Obama should resist the temptation to put another target-focused operator at the helm of the CIA. Another main civilian component of U.S. power is its diplomacy. Obama should also use this moment of transition to think through what kind of State Department he really needs. The instruments of U.S. foreign policy are multiple, varied and subtle in their application. To avail itself of them, the government needs smart, adaptable, dynamic risk-takers, who think strategically and operate with autonomy. Such people must be attracted to government service and provided responsibilities commensurate with their talents. But the other national security topic of the moment threatens to push Obama in the wrong direction. The death of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens in Benghazi, Libya, has been politicized in deeply counterproductive ways. Members of Congress should bear that in mind as they continue examining the details of the attack. Stevens was exactly the type of diplomat the U.S. government needs: someone with long experience in the region to which he was posted, an ambassador who engaged with people, gained insight into the environment and helped influence it. That kind of diplomacy is essential, but it carries risks. If it becomes politically untenable in Washington for an ambassador to die in the line of duty, then talented diplomats will be hobbled. And faced with a choked career path, the best will look elsewhere for rewarding work. Obama should appoint a secretary of State determined to counteract the tendency to retrench. Perhaps the most important foreign policy challenge Obama faces in his second term is how to expand, restructure and reinforce the range of civilian instruments of U.S. power. That is a generational task, but one the current crisis has provided an unparalleled opportunity to tackle.

Until recently, the daily release included Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's schedule only. No longer. \"Steinberg will meet Wednesday with Singaporean Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean.\" The inclusion of Steinberg suggests that the department is aware that it needs to do a better job of integrating Steinberg's portfolio into its general communications strategy and show how the leadership of the department acts in concert. \"Jim has always been an integral part of the Secretary's team, but we haven't always shown how crucial he is to State's mission,\" said Philippe Reines, Clinton's communications consiglieri. \"This is a one simple way to fix that.\" The Beltway rumor mill often includes gossip that Steinberg isn't happy, or that he's not seen as an integral part of President Obama's foreign policy team, or that his efforts aren't appreciated. Reines, who rarely speaks on the record, responded to a question about whether Steinberg is indeed unhappy in this way: \"I'm not a shrink, and I have to confess that we don't sit around in a circle often enough exploring our feelings. But what is crystal clear to everyone is that Jim is smart, dedicated, and valued.\" Steinberg has a been a principal adviser on issues ranging from Iran -- he is the administration's team lead, cybersecurity and China (he's been tasked with pressuring China into accepting tougher sanctions on Iran), but his work often goes unnoticed. On Friday, he is said to have given a tongue-lashing to the Israeli Ambassador to the U.S., Michael Oren, about that country's actions during a visit by Vice President Biden. When President Obama selected Gen. Jim Jones as National Security Adviser, he asked Clinton to make Steinberg her deputy -- and she did. Since day one, prognosticators have been predicting friction between Steinberg and Clinton, although none has publicly surfaced."

Sid Below is a transcript from Israeli TV News Channel Ten on a leaked poll taken last week by Frank Luntz. Here's a summary: 1. 56% of Americans agree with the claim that there is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza; 2. 43% of Americans agree with the claim that people in Gaza are starving; 3. 34% of Americans support the Israeli operation against the Flotilla; 4. 20% of Americans \"felt support\" for Israel following announcement of easing of Gaza closure. Frank Luntz analyses Netanyahu's media performance in the flotilla affair The figures are troubling and worrisome. If that is the situation with our great friend the US, it is easy to imagine the situation in other, somewhat less sympathetic countries. Channel Ten TV News, July 1 2010 20:38 Yaacov Eilon (host): Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considered to make an extremely persuasive presentation in the world press. But a professional analysis by a US expert presented yesterday to his senior aides strongly criticizes him. Netanyahu's messages on the flotilla caused more harm than good. Our political correspondent Chico Menashe has obtained the report. Chico Menashe: Criticism of Prime Minister Netanyahu's current PR messages and Israeli PR in general comes from the international elite of media consultants and pollsters and from the mouth of Frank Luntz, considered one of the leading American political consultants, a Republican pollster, a consultant to many governments throughout the world and to dozens of the biggest corporations in the US. He was asked by the Jewish organization The Israel Project to check the opinions of the American public on the messages Israel issued to the world during and after the flotilla events. The result is a harsh document that primarily criticizes the media strategy of the person considered Israel's number one propagandist in the world, Prime Minister Netanyahu. Netanyahu: Once again Israel faces hypocrisy and a biased rush to judgment. Chico Menashe: Every time Israeli speakers begin with accusing the international community, writes Luntz, they lose their audience. For example, Netanyahu's comments after the flotilla about the world hypocrisy were rejected by most of the American participants who listened to them. The findings were presented last night to senior members of Netanyahu's Bureau. Luntz checked the opinions with focus groups, not a poll. He warns of a dangerous slide in the public opinion of the only country considered pro-Israeli, the U.S. Israel misses simple opportunities to change world public opinion, he writes, and the consequences are significant. The American public increasingly hesitates to accept arguments that support Israeli positions. Ehud Barak: There is no hunger in Gaza and no humanitarian crisis. Netanyahu: There's no shortage of food, there's no shortage of medicine, there's no shortage of other goods. Chico Menashe: Luntz says Israel must immediately stop using the argument that there is no hunger and no humanitarian crisis in Gaza. He says this fatally destroys Israel's credibility in light of the images on the television screens. Israel must admit that there is a problem, he says, to gain the listeners' sympathy [emphasis mine]. Luntz finds the troubling figure that 56% of participants agree with the claim that there is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and no less astonishing is that 43% of participants from the American public agree with the claim that people in Gaza are starving. But even lifting the closure that was supposed to improve Israel's image missed the opportunity, according to Luntz. Netanyahu: Yesterday an important decision was made by the security cabinet. Its meaning is clear. On the one hand, allowing civilian goods into Gaza, and on the other hand maintaining the military blockade of Hamas. Chico Menashe: The statement by Netanyahu's bureau of lifting the closure missed the opportunity to gain support in international public opinion [emphasis mine]. Only 20% of the Americans polled felt support of Israel following the statement. According to Lunt, this is the summary of the flotilla damage in American public opinion: Only 34% of the American public support the Israeli operation against the flotilla, and he says that is a dangerously low percentage."

"C05770304"	"Madam Secretary, As requested, below is a brief bio (compiled by DK, INR, and AF) of Kenyan Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Richard Momoima Onyonka, who you met in Krakow at the Community of Democracies. Please let me know if you would like any further information or follow up on this. Thanks, Mike Richard Momoima Onyonka is a Kenyan politician and belongs to the People's Democratic Party. Born in 1962 and hailing from the Bogeka clan, VM Momoima has lived in Otamba, Nyamataro, Mosocho and Nairobi. In 1982, following the failed Kenyan coup d'etat attempt to overthrow President Daniel Arap Moi's government, VM Momoima was among the 900 people that were jailed. However, in 1984, he returned to the University of Nairobi and graduated with a Bachelors degree in commerce a year later. After graduation, VM Momoima attended North Carolina State University where he graduated with a Masters degree in management. He returned to Kenya in 1992 during the first multi party elections to help his father (then incumbent MP for Kitutu Chache and Minister for Planning and National Development) who was seeking re-election on a KANU (Kenya African National Union) ticket. VM Momoima's first political opportunity arose when his father passed away in 1996, which prompted an election in which he lost to a new corner during the party (KANU) nominations. Since the Kenyan parliamentary election in 2007, VM Momoima has represented the Kitutu Chache Constituency in the National Assembly of Kenya. A financial economist by profession, VM Momoima currently runs personal businesses in Nairobi and Kisii and has held positions in the Kisii KANU branch. His priorities include economic empowerment, particularly for youth and women, education, and poverty reduction. Michael H. Fuchs U.S. Department of State (202) 647-1709 B6"

"C05766357"	"H: Of interest, Hague latest briefing, hostile to Tony. Tories desperately do not want Blair there, want to run their own European policy, mostly anti-EU, and indeed break with past and continuity on Europe. Tory Party split, with anti-EU faction dominant, its base virulent, and Cameron straddling as best he can. Hague leans anti-Europe. S London Times October 22, 2009 `Appointing Blair as EU president will have consequences', warns Hague William Hague's strident attack on his fellow Briton reportedly left some of the EU ambassadors baffled Francis Elliott, David Charter and Tom Baldwin William Hague has been conducting a behind-the-scenes campaign to convince European ambassadors that Tony Blair would be a bad choice for European Union president, The Times has learnt. The Shadow Foreign Secretary used a lunch organised by the Swedish presidency in London last week to lobby the most senior diplomats of the 26 other EU nations against the appointment. EU leaders had hoped to choose the new president at next week's summit, but the Czech Republic's last-minute objections to the Lisbon treaty have scuppered that. President Sarkozy of France wants a quick decision, however, and is understood to be pushing for a special one-day summit in Brussels next month to fill the new post. In making the Conservatives' case against Mr Blair, Mr Hague said that while in Downing Street the former Prime Minister had consistently placed a higher priority on US interests than on those of Europe. Mr Hague also reminded the diplomats of Mr Blair's actions in the run-up to the Iraq war, according to one of those attending the lunch last Thursday. A claim that Mr Hague told the ambassadors that the Tories would regard Mr Blair's appointment as a \"declaration of war\" by the EU was denied, however. A spokesman for Mr Hague said that the phrase was \"a bit strong\". Nevertheless, it was not disputed that Mr Hague made clear that the move would have consequences for relations between Britain and Brussels. Diplomats said that there was a \"clear mark of hostility\". \"Mr Hague wanted to leave the ambassadors in no doubt that the Conservative Party is opposed to the appointment of Tony Blair as president of the European Council and [that] it would only underline the lack of accountability and legitimacy involved in the creation of the position in the first place,\" Mr Hague's spokesman said. Mr Hague's strident attack on his fellow Briton reportedly left some of the ambassadors baffled. Mr Hague is currently in Washington for talks with members of the Obama Administration, including Hillary Clinton, the Secretary of State, with whom he raised the issue of the Conservatives' membership of a right-wing alliance of European parties with allegedly anti-Semitic members. He accused critics of running a smear campaign against some of the group, led by Michal Kaminsky, head of Poland's Law and Justice Party."

"C05764139"	"Hillary: Peter Galbraith just called me and I had a long talk with him. As you know, as chief of US mission to UN in Afghanistan he has protested the election fraud and come into conflict with the head of UN there, who wanted to cover it up. Peter has just come out of Afghanistan after four solid months there. He is pessimistic, says the analogy to Vietnam is not wrong-headed, that comparisons of increasing troop levels there as though the surge in Iraq could be replicated are misguided, but thinks there is an approach that should be attempted that involves the vote recount and trying to replace Karzai. He wishes to speak with you directly. He says that he has difficulty communicating with Holbrooke, not because he can't reach him, but because he finds Dick disjointed these days. Peter is on a plane right now to Norway, then London, then to NY on Wed, then could go to DC. He says you can reach him through the US mission to the UN office. FYI, from Wash Post today: \"The issue of how seriously to take the fraud charges, and whether to force a runoff, has also caused a rare public rift within the international community here. The senior American official at the U.N. mission, Peter W. Galbraith, left the country abruptly Sunday in a dispute with the mission director, Norwegian Kai Eide. \"Galbraith had pushed for an exhaustive probe. Sources who are familiar with the dispute but are not authorized to. speak on the record said Eide argued that the international community should not press too hard because it could undermine national stability. Galbraith had been convinced that Karzai could not win without fraud and had tried to reduce the number of polling stations in some areas in the south, the incumbent's ethnic stronghold, said one diplomatic source. Eide and others, the source said, were convinced that Karzai would win in any case and that any irregularities could be smoothed over, as they were in the 2004 presidential election that Karzai won by a safe margin.\" And, I've included below Jane Smiley's rave review of Max's book. Sid http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jane-smiley/republican-gomorrah_b290293.html Your request is being processed... Jane Smiley Pulitzer Prize-Winning Novelist and Essayist Posted: September 17, 2009 02:56 PM HuffPost Book Review: Republican Gomorrah About twenty years ago, I read an article about a death row inmate who had shot a clerk in a convenience store. The way the murder was presented by the man on death row was mysterious--his hand just rose up and the gun went off. Shooting the clerk in the face in the midst of a robbery wasn't in fact his fault. He never said, \"I shot a man.\" It just happened. I thought of that man while reading Max Blumenthal's terrific, but also, of course, appalling new book, Republican Gomorrah. Apparently there isn't a single person in the present incarnation of the Republican party who does anything. Things happen--God does it. Satan does it. No Republican is an agent of his or her own success or failure, sin or redemption. It just happens. The consequences of this lack of responsibility are there for all to see--screaming threats, guns at rallies, unhinged behavior every time a Republican doesn't feel the way he or she wants to feel, absolute sense of powerlessness leading directly to an absolute will to power. Because that was the thing that struck me about the murderer in the 7-11--he had the power and in his own last moments, the clerk knew it. But the killer, no matter how well armed, never felt it. Republican Gomorrah is a frightening book because it is clear to all of us on the outside that the various Republican operatives who surround James Dobson and his ilk have no consciences and will stop at nothing. They invoke the name of God for purposes that shame God absolutely--hurting, destroying, maiming, and damning others who either don't accept their beliefs or don't acknowledge their power and righteousness. Of course that is frightening. But Blumenthal's cast of characters, beginning with Dobson and his prodigal son, Ryan, and including John Hagee, Sarah Palin, Ralph Reed, Charles Colson, Judith Reisman, Christina Regnery, Donald Wildmon, et al. strike the reader as above all else very small--egocentric, narrow minded, uneducated, selfish, and resentful. Each of these qualities is destructive in and of itself The combination is turning out to be coercive. Even those of us who are immune to the emotions these people play upon are getting more and more nervous about the power that they wish to exert. Blumenthal does two things that no one else I have read manages to do--the first of these is that he organizes the network. He shows how Ted Bundy is connected to James Dobson is connected to Gary Bauer is connected to Erik Prince is connected to Ralph Reed is connected to Jack Abramoff is connected to Tom Delay is connected to Tony Perkins is connected to David Duke is connected to Mel Gibson, and so forth, and in the course of tracing these connections, he informs us, or reminds us, of the crimes and misdemeanors these people have committed. Two of my favorites are James Dobson's son Ryan's messy divorce (Dad seems to have paid the settlement--did he not dare to discipline? Or did he discipline too much?) and David Vitter's habitual recourse to a brothel in New Orleans where Republicans \"wanted to be spanked and tortured and wear stockings--Republicans have impeccable taste in silk stockings\" (the madam is talking about men). Republican Gomorrah is full of crimes-- both those we've already heard of, such as Abramoffs and Ted Haggard's, and those we haven't (there is good evidence that Texas billionaire T. Cullen Davis, funder of the right wing Council For National Policy, ordered hits on his estranged wife, and succeeded in murdering his step-daughter and the wife's boyfriend). This aspect of the book reminds me of a Scottish novel called The Private Memoirs And Confessions Of A Justified Sinner by James Hogg, in which, once a man believes he is among the saved, he can commit any sin he wants to and be sure he will go to heaven. Once Davis was \"saved,\" for example, he said, \"My goal is to get to heaven. I'll do anything it takes to get there, and I'm not going to let anything stand in my way.\" He must have thought getting to heaven was just another power play. And power plays are the key to right wing psychology. Right wing psychology is the other thing that Blumenthal has to offer. At the periphery of this world is your run-of-the-mill bully, a man like Jack Abramoff, whose brutality is well remembered by his high school classmates, but who sang like a bird once he was caught. At the center of is James Dobson, a much more destructive figure than Abramoff, who advocates, in the strongest terms, child beating, and not only child-beating, but dog-beating. At one point he brags about going after the family canine (who weighed twelve pounds) and engaging in \"the most vicious fight ever staged between man and beast.\" As for children, the goal is to keep beating the child until \"he wants(s) to crumple on the breast of his parent.\" In other words, Dobson is a proud sadist who thinks sadism is kind of funny, and who, over the years, has successfully advocated sadism as the only workable form of child-rearing. It order to understand the deeply disturbing effect Dobson and his theories have had on our culture, Blumenthal cites Erich Fromm's Escape from Freedom, about the psychology of Nazism and authoritarianism, and Eric Hoffer's The True Believer. Insofar as he finds the documentation, Blumenthal points out how many of these powerful Evangelical Christians were beaten and abused as children (including Dobson). It's a high number. The beatings, often arbitrary, cruel, and frequent, were then, in many cases, backed up with constant lessons about God--that he is arbitrary, that he is cruel, that he demands obedience above all things, and that he surpasseth understanding. The point of these exercises is to establish the powerlessness of the child, his shame and guilt as a worthless sinner, and his absolute fear of thinking for himself He will then take his place in the hierarchy and thereby reinforce the existence of the hierarchy. Blumenthal goes pretty far with this psychology, but, in my view, not far enough. I'm sure he was reared by liberal parents, who gave him a sense of responsibility, curiosity, and autonomy, and since he is only in his thirties, I don't think that he really empathizes with the tortured and damaged souls that he has been interviewing and watching for the last few years. I don't think he understands their fear--how deep it is, how constant it is, and how arousing it is. I don't think, in fact, that Max Blumenthal looks within and sees evil. I think he looks within, and says, \"I'm okay; you're okay.\" That's the goal of liberal parenting, and as we can tell by statistics he cites concerning unwed pregnancy, divorce, and occurrence of STDs, liberal parenting works-- atheists and agnostics, for example, have a much lower rate of divorce than Evangelicals, and states that have sex education in the schools, rather than abstinence-only education, have lower rates of teen pregnancy. But a child who is beaten enough eventually comes to understand two things above all--that the world makes no sense (and so why try to make sense of it?) and that the world is so dangerous that to be oneself, or even to try to figure out what oneself might be, is a death-defying exercise. There is safety only in two things--conforming to a group and, as a part of that group, dominating and even destroying other groups. The rules of the group can be anything at all, as long as the members of the group abide by them. And other groups have to abide by them, too, or the painful and arbitrary rules that group abides by are meaningless. The beaten child's sense of terror can only be assuaged by evanescent feelings of power, because in relation to his parents and to God, he is defined as powerless. When he \"crumples\" on the \"loving\" breast of his parent (and in my view a person who administers a beating to a living being who is 1/16th his size doesn't know what love is) he accepts his powerlessness and he also accepts that power is what defines this life. That's where your freedom and mine come in. Many of the Evangelicals Blumenthal discusses are Christian Dominionists--that is, they differ from the Taliban only in their choice of doctrine. Their uses of that doctrine (to dehumanize women and other groups, to never share power, to control every aspect of every life within their power, and to create society as a steeply hierarchical structure with them at the top) are those of the Taliban. It's an eye-opener to read about R.J. Rushdoony, son of Armenian immigrants who fled the Armenian genocide of 1915. You would think that a man whose family escaped mass murder would go on to espouse peace, love, and understanding, but Rushdoony went the other way, taking literally the 613 laws in the Book of Leviticus. In his book, The Institutes of Biblical Law, he advocates capital punishment for \"disobedient children, unchaste women, apostates, blasphemers, practitioners of witchcraft, adulterers,\" and homosexuals. Gary North, the Presbyterian Christian Reconstructionist, is his son-in-law, and, while not backing down on the mass death penalty, advocates stoning rather than burning at the stake, because stoning is cheaper (and of course that is a factor, because there would be a lot of people to exterminate). As for who would be doing the killing (of you and me, if they could catch us), well, Christians would, but not because they wanted to. Ever unable to accept responsibility, they assign agency to God, who wants us killed, who will beat us until we \"crumple\" on his \"loving\" breast, a God who has given us all sorts of talents, skills, and interests, but is, like these Christian Dominionists, interested only in power. I believe his motto is \"Adore me or I will hurt you.\" Can you believe in a God so small? When I was a parent of young children, I, too, got frustrated, and I, too, thought a spanking might be a good thing. I soon realized that my motives for administering physical punishment were highly suspect--more anger and frustration than care for the child or knowledge about effective methods. I then saw a show about child-rearing, in which a woman who firmly believed in child- between man and beast.\" As for children, the goal is to keep beating the child until \"he wants(s) to crumple on the breast of his parent.\" In other words, Dobson is a proud sadist who thinks sadism is kind of funny, and who, over the years, has successfully advocated sadism as the only workable form of child-rearing.

I soon realized that my motives for administering physical punishment were highly suspect--more anger and frustration than care for the child or knowledge about effective methods. I then saw a show about child-rearing, in which a woman who firmly believed in child- beating aroused far more resistance in her beaten daughter, and had much more family disruption, than the parents who ignored the tantrum and then used the technique of redirection to train their toddlers. Works with horses, dogs, and other animals, too. It was then I decided that if I, in my human weakness, could put two and two together concerning free will and proper behavior, surely God could, also. I didn't want to believe in a God who was a smaller being than myself. And I don't. The ray of hope in Blumenthal's book is that the right-wingers he talks about tend to be so psychologically unstable that they don't have much staying power--think Ted Haggard. But they have numbers. The bad thing about that is that they could take control. The defeat of Sarah Palin, Conrad Burns (R-MT), George Allen (R- VA), Rick Santorum (R-PA), James Talent (R-MO), and Mike DeWine (R-OH) brought us \"back from the brink\" according to the website Theocracy Watch. But only back from the brink. The good thing is that they would not be able to maintain what we call a government for very long (see George W. Bush). The bad thing is that they would destroy the country as we know it while they were trying. If I take the long view, well, I think, Stalinism lasted about 25 years, Nazism 12. The Iranian Mullahs have been at it for 30 years. Russia and Germany survived, Iran might, as well. But generations were lost in all these places. And Stalin and Hitler didn't have nuclear weapons. I think about the 22-year-old clerk in that convenience store, looking down the barrel of that pistol. He probably had no idea that his killer had no sense of agency, hardly even knew what he was doing, was seeing his hand as separate from himself. But I have to feel sorry for the killer, too, subject to feelings that he could not label that were terrifying and overpowering. I bet he was beaten, shamed, and neglected as a child. I bet, afterward, he wished someone, somehow, had stopped him.

It's the kind of typical collective dissection we have now come to expect but that never really existed before: serious, speculative, arcane, funny, brilliant, baked, etc. The Sunliaht Foundation b!000inci is predictably good. Paul Blumenthal dips into the multinational dimension of the new \"corporation as full citizen-person\" framework, drawing on blogging going on at Neytsweqk and the CerAer for Pubiic inte'r'. \"Looks like [the Court] might support allowing foreign companies to spend freely in elections in the United States. I guess this would be the corporate globalization of the U.S. electoral system.\" So you gotta ask yourself: Who does Hugo Chavez want for President? Blumenthal excerpting the Center for Public Integrity: The Center for Public Integrity looks at this closer and shows what kind of foreign influence we are looking at: One prominent examples is CITGO Petroleum Company — once the American-born Cities Services Company, but purchased in 1990 by the Venezuelan government-owned Petroieos de Venezuela S.A. The Citizens United ruling could conceivably allow Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who has sharply criticized both of the past two U.S. presidents, to spend government funds to defeat an American political candidate, just by having CITGO buy TV ads bashing his target. And it's not just Chavez. The Saudi government owns Houston's Saudi Refining Company and half of Motive Enterprises. Lenovo, which bought IBM's PC assets in 2004, is partially owned by the Chinese government's Chinese Academy of Sciences. And Singapore's APL Limited operates several U.S. port operations. A weakening of the limit on corporate giving could mean China, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and any other country that owns companies that operate in the U.S. could also have significant sway in American electioneering. I really can't see Americans being too happy about this. ha Lithwick reported :rC(' .ate from the Supreme Court as the opinions were being read. She offered this aside: While Stevens is reading the portion of his concurrence about the \"cautious view of corporate power\" held by the framers, I see Justice Thomas chuckle softly. Was it a disdainful chuckle at the impotence of his colleague? Was it merely a chuckle of disagreement, of good-natured exasperation? Was it a chuckle at an anachronistic vision of the framers set beside today's modern corporate silicon and steel behemoths? I doubt he was thinking about Hugo Chavez."

AM The Crossroads Nation By DAVID BROOKS Bill Clinton used to talk about building a bridge to the 21st century. President Obama talks about laying down a \"new foundation.\" But Clinton was always vague about what the land on the other side of that bridge was going to look like, and Obama is vague about what edifice is going to go on top of that foundation. They are vague because nobody is clear about what sort of country America is going to be in 2030 or 2050. Nobody has quite defined America's coming economic identity. In thinking about this question, it probably helps to start at the beginning. Five hundred years ago, agriculture was the major economic activity. One hundred years ago, it was industrial production. Now, of course, we're living in an information age. Innovation and creativity are the engines of economic growth. Howard Gardner of Harvard once put together a composite picture of the extraordinarily creative person: She comes from a little place somewhat removed from the center of power and influence. As an adolescent, she feels herself outgrowing her own small circle. She moves to a metropolis and finds a group of people who share her passions and interests. She gets involved with a team to create something amazing. Then, at some point, she finds her own problem, which is related to and yet different from the problems that concern others in her group. She breaks off and struggles and finally emerges with some new thing. She brings it back to her circle. It is tested, refined and improved. The main point in this composite story is that creativity is not a solitary process. It happens within networks. It happens when talented people get together, when idea systems and mentalities merge. Now imagine you are this creative person in the year 2010, 2025 or 2050. You are living in some small town in Ukraine or Kenya or some other place, foreign or domestic. You long to break out and go to a place where people are gathering to think about the things you are thinking about, creating the things you want to create. If you are passionate about fashion, maybe you will go to Paris. If it's engineering, maybe it'll be Germany. But if you are passionate about many other spheres, I suspect you'll want to be in America. You'll want to be in the U.S. because English has become the global language. You'll want to come because American universities lead the world in research and draw many of the best minds from all corners of the earth. You'll want to be there because American institutions are relatively free from corruption. Intellectual property is protected. Huge venture capital funds already exist. Moreover, the United States is a universal nation. There are already people there with connections all over the world. A nation of immigrants is more permeable than say, Chinese society. You also observe that America hosts the right kind of networks — ones that are flexible and intense. Study after study suggests that America is one of those societies with high social trust. Americans build large, efficient organizations that are not bound by the circles of kinship and clan. Study after study finds that Americans are not hierarchical. American children are raised to challenge their parents. American underlings are relatively free to challenge their bosses. In this country you're less likely to have to submit to authority. From this story you can see that economic power in the 21st century is not going to look like economic power in the 20th century. The crucial fact about the new epoch is that creativity needs hubs. Information networks need junction points. The nation that can make itself the crossroads to the world will have tremendous economic and political power. In 2009, Anne-Marie Slaughter, now director of policy planning at the State Department, wrote an essay for Foreign Affairs in which she laid out the logic of this new situation: \"In a networked world, the issue is no longer relative power, but centrality in an increasingly dense global web.\" Slaughter's essay was titled \"America's Edge.\" That is apt. Americans are now in a depressed state of mind. As China and India rise, nearly two-thirds of Americans believe their nation is in decline. In fact, the U.S. is well situated to be the crossroads nation. It is well situated to be the center of global networks and to nurture the right kinds of networks. Building that America means doing everything possible to thicken connections: finance research to attract scientists; improve infrastructure to ease travel; fix immigration to funnel talent; reform taxes to attract superstars; make study abroad a rite of passage for college students; take advantage of the millions of veterans who have served overseas. The nation with the thickest and most expansive networks will define the age. There's no reason to be pessimistic about that."

"C05766739"	"To rebuild Haiti, start with its young people A 700,000-strong national civic service corps would harness untapped labor rapidly and instill national pride and confidence. By Robert Muggah and Robert Maguire January 31, 2010 Haiti will need big ideas to recover and rebuild in the aftermath of the devastating magnitude 7.0 earthquake this month. The reported death toll has topped 150,000, and the reconstruction needs are incalculable. How about starting with a 700,000-strong national civic service corps made up of Haitian youth? There are many reasons why such an entity makes a lot of sense. Haiti is a young country. An estimated 70% of the population is under 30; the 15-to-29 segment alone makes up 50% of the population. Demographers have long cautioned how excessively youthful populations can potentially exacerbate underdevelopment and accentuate political instability. Although Haiti registers among the lowest levels of education in the Western Hemisphere, Haitian youth are a wellspring of creativity, talent and potential. You don't need to be a community-development specialist to know that they are stifled by a lack of meaningful opportunities. Fortunately, Haiti has an enabling environment to set up a civic service corps. Article 52 of the Haitian Constitution commits citizens to national service, though it has never been activated. What is more, there are many Haitian and international organizations mobilized and ready to help the government get this going. A civic service corps would get the young and able out of the tent cities in and around Port-au-Prince and into work. They could start with the once-iconic center of the capital, but also could begin planting trees, working the fields and providing services in Haiti's countryside. At a minimum, this would reverse generations of unfair stigmatizing of the youth there. This plan would also harness untapped labor rapidly. Before the Jan. 12 earthquake, 50% of youth in their 20s were out of work. Putting them in service toward rebuilding the capital and outlying areas would be a first step to restoring their and their country's pride and dignity. A civic service corps would also multiply international efforts to promote recovery after the world moves on to the next crisis. Hundreds of humanitarian agencies, donor governments and nongovernmental organizations are facing monumental challenges in coordinating relief assistance. Although everyone involved is committed to rapid disbursement, transaction costs are monumental. A civic service corps would allow for a more rapid form of transferring capital. Direct support to such a corps would inject serious liquidity into the Haitian economy and stimulate recovery from the bottom up. Rather than food-for-work schemes, international best practice recommends proposals that promote direct monetary transfers to beneficiaries. Haitian youth and their families have urgent needs and don't need paternalistic programs that curb their choices. With proper oversight and financial safeguards, a civic service corps would circumvent unnecessary administrative costs. Further, a civic service corps would restore national pride and confidence in Haitian public institutions. During past decades, the state provided relatively few services to Haitians, particularly outside the capital. In some cases, state entities were downright predatory. As a result, nonstate providers, including gangs and shady middlemen, filled the gap. A civic service corps -- wearing the Haitian colors and acting as first responders or organizations demonstrating the government's presence on the ground -- would show that the government is serious about supporting citizens. It would be a symbolic first step toward renewing the social contract with the people. A civic service corps also makes sense for long-term risk and emergency planning. Haiti is situated in the path of hurricanes and on a fault line, and can expect more disasters. Training 700,000 young people -- especially young women -- in the basics of first aid, emergency response, community policing and other skills would greatly mitigate the consequences of future calamities. With disciplined training and management, the corps could provide more intensive training in specialized areas -- engineering, telecommunications and public health. An initial step to getting Haiti's youth to work could include the preparation of a road map for future meetings on Haiti, including the U.N. donor conference scheduled for March. Any final plan would need to draw on the invaluable experiences of ongoing efforts to mobilize youth in Haiti. These include the work of the Brazilian nongovernmental organization Viva Rio and its supporters. Before the earthquake, Viva Rio and Brazilian peacekeepers had recruited and trained hundreds of Haitian youth, including former gang members, to provide relief services in Haiti's slums. This program could be reactivated and scaled up quickly. A civic service corps could draw on the lessons from such groups to target and recruit youths for, say, up to two years. The Haitian government would, of course, need to be the one to manage the undertaking, with direct oversight from the president's office and the Interior Ministry. And there are many countries that could provide advice and support. Nongovernmental groups and private donors could also play a key role in mobilizing support and transferring essential skills. Haiti's youth are the future of the nation, and they are central to Haiti's recovery. A civic service corps is a large-scale way to quickly mobilize them to act as catalyst for long-term, progressive changes. Robert Muggah, based at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, is a principal of the SecDev Group and is currently advising multilateral and bilateral organizations on Haiti's recovery. Robert Maguire is on the faculty of Trinity Washington University and chairs the Haiti Working Group of the United States Institute of Peace in Washington. Copyright (c) 2010, The Los Angeles Times"

Tick, tock, another day gone. Sid September 3, 2010 Americans Most Likely to Favor GOP Newcomers for Congress Three in four believe influx of new members would improve Congress by Jeffrey M. Jones PRINCETON, NJ -- It appears that the best type of candidate to be this fall is a Republican challenger. Given a choice of four hypothetical candidates of differing party affiliations and experience, Americans are most likely to prefer \"a Republican who has not served in Congress.\" Those who would prefer a Democratic candidate opt for an incumbent over a newcomer. These results, based on an Aug. 27-30 USA Today/Gallup poll, underscore the advantageous political environment for Republicans and non-incumbents this midterm election season. Overall, a majority of Americans prefer a Republican candidate (regardless of experience) to a Democrat, 53% to 40%. And a majority also prefer a non-incumbent (regardless of party affiliation) to an incumbent, 54% to 39%. The fact that Americans who prefer a Republican candidate want one who is new to Congress suggests that these voters want both GOP control of Congress and the new perspectives that come from members with no prior Washington experience. Americans who favor Democratic candidates, on the other hand, apparently are more satisfied with the type of experienced representatives now in Congress. One would naturally expect Democrats to prefer Democratic candidates, and Republicans to prefer Republican candidates, and that is the case when looking at the data by party. But partisans' preferences for incumbents versus challengers seem to be influenced by their knowledge that the Democrats currently have a majority in Congress, and thus, more Democrats will be defending House seats this fall. Democrats are more likely to prefer a Democrat who is in Congress to a Democrat who is not, and Republicans are more likely to prefer a Republican outside of Congress to one who is currently serving there. Independents also show a strong preference for Republican non-incumbents. The data do not necessarily indicate how Americans would vote in the fall when presented with a choice of two specific candidates for Congress. This fall, voters will generally be asked to choose between one Republican and one Democratic candidate, one of whom may be an incumbent. When asked in the same poll whether they are more likely to vote for the Republican or the Democratic congressional candidate in their district if the elections were held today, 48% of Americans say the Republican and 43% the Democrat. The appeal of non-incumbents is apparent in another question in the poll that finds 75% of Americans saying Congress would be changed for the better if \"most of the present members of Congress are replaced with new members.\" Only 14% think that would make Congress worse. This is consistent with Gallup's findings from earlier this year suggesting strong anti-incumbent sentiment. Americans across key demographic subgroups widely share the belief that Congress would be improved if most members were turned out of office. However, there is a significant gap by political party, with 89% of Republicans versus 63% of Democrats saying that replacing most members of Congress would be beneficial. Again, the difference likely stems from Democrats' current status as the majority party in Congress. Implications In a year when Americans are dissatisfied with the state of the nation and give relatively low ratings to the president and Congress, it is not politically beneficial to be either an incumbent or a member of the ruling party. That is reflected in Americans' preference for a Republican newcomer over other types of candidates they may have a chance to vote for in this fall's midterm congressional elections. It is also reflected in prior analysis of historical Gallup data showing greater seat turnover in Congress when the president and Congress are unpopular."

"C05766507"	"Below is from the Economist blogger re efforts wil EU to discredit Ashton, particularly from the French. Wouldn't hurt to mention her positively with French interlocutors. See particularly this line: \"There is, frankly, a whiff of old boy's network against Lady Ashton: she is not a lifetime member of the honourable guild of former foreign ministers, and she is surrounded by men in suits who think they know a lot more about foreign policy than she does. There is not much sympathy for her complicated family life, involving young children, and much commuting between Brussels and Britain.\" A blog by the author of our column on the European Union Charlemagne's notebook . Why did Lady Ashton take the EU's foreign policy job? • Jan 26th 2010, 22:04 NOT yet February, and the briefing against Catherine Ashton, the newly appointed EU foreign policy chief, is getting nasty. Jean Quatremer, the Brussels blogger and well-connected EU correspondent of Liberation, dropped another depth charge against the baroness tonight. His list of complaints against her is long, and I have a feeling some of them are a smidgeon exaggerated. I find it hard to believe it is literally impossible to reach Lady Ashton after eight o'clock in the evening as Mr Quatremer charges, because she allegedly has her mobile telephones diverted to the EU situation centre (a small intelligence analysis cell staffed by officers from national servicies) after that hour. I also have some doubts about the stress laid on the fact that she has not yet got round to having top secret security clearance yet, so cannot see any confidential papers. As a former British cabinet minister, and serving UK commissioner, something tells me the British at least may share just the odd secret with her. A senior official I saw today also made the point that any holder of Lady Ashton's post would currently be struggling with teething problems and squabbling as the new foreign policy apparatus created by the Lisbon Treaty takes shape. There is, frankly, a whiff of old boy's network against Lady Ashton: she is not a lifetime member of the honourable guild of former foreign ministers, and she is surrounded by men in suits who think they know a lot more about foreign policy than she does. There is not much sympathy for her complicated family life, involving young children, and much commuting between Brussels and Britain. Finally, at the risk of sounding too loyal to the British, I think Mr Quatremer is being unfair when he says that it suits the Foreign Office in London to have Lady Ashton \"sabotage\" the post. My impression is that aritich nnvornmpni- fPPlc I (iv Achtnn nePdc a lot of sunnort riaht now and worries she is not getting enough support, but at the same time worries that if she receives too much help in the way of briefings and advice from British officials, she will be seen as a British stooge. That may be a self-serving sort of fear (because it allows the British to offer Lady Ashton lots of help) but it is real enough. Other charges probably have something to them. They certainly chime with things I have been told by other people. But most damaging, to my mind, is the intimate nature of some of the briefing: this stuff is coming from officials close to Lady Ashton, or who are senior enough to have significant contact with her. And I can confirm from my own conversations that people across the whole EU foreign policy machine are asking the same question: why did she take this huge job, when her instinct seems to be to make it as low key as possible? That is a dangerous question mark to have hanging over you."

"C05764995"	"See below. Will send PIR comments shortly. To: CDM Fr: Caitlin Re: Branch Book Overview: There are few surprises in this book. The \"surprises\" that might exist are buried and took a close reading to pick up on—the two main ones are about the terror clause of WJC's crime bill and why he hadn't disclosed information about Lewinsky (because he hadn't wanted to become a witness against her). There are a lot of things that have been covered in My Life and other publications. Quite honestly the book was pretty boring and much more focused on Branch than I had anticipated. While not as \"and this day, and the next day\" as My Life, it does share many of the same elements that would engage only a true Clinton fanatic or historian. The fact that there appears to be no index also makes it difficult for anyone looking for a quick hit to get one. Furthermore, WJC's words are so interlaced with Branch's recollection through his dictations, that the number of direct WJC quotes was far fewer than I had expected. HRC was not as much of a player as one might imagine. Her role is largely seen through her interactions with Branch when he is recording WJC. Her statements were consistent with the past, with the exception of the Gephardt comment, and didn't grab much attention at all.Ell (Others included HRC's devotion to CVC, thought that there should not be a special prosecutor and images of her returning from meetings. They were pretty much aligned with her interactions with Branch.) Surprisingly, or not surprisingly, many of the problems discussed in the book are those, which face the current Administration—Middle East peace, North Korea, China, etc... Branch repeatedly injects his feelings on specific subjects and seems to use the book to voice his own opinion of the Administration and events of the time. He clearly has topics he prefers over others (for example his connection with the events in Haiti result in a lot of discussion about it), but there are some subjects that are strikingly sparsely discussed such as Rwanda. Its absence from long discussions was surprising, but it did not appear as thought WJC ever-dodged questions about the topic, they just weren't addressed. Much like My Life, one theme that repeated itself was WJC's conflict with and disdain for the media, especially long passages about NYT and Washington Post. There are a few instances where gives them credit on their reporting, but you would be hard-pressed to find them. Additionally, there are numerous mentions of WJC's acute allergies and his chronic fatigue, with imagery of him falling asleep in sessions on more than a couple occasions. The book has quite a bit on Whitewater, but given the dearth of public documentation there is little that Branch could write that hadn't been said. One thing I had not recalled was the D'Amato's subpoena of CVC's friends, later quashed, who slept over while HRC's Rose Law Firm records were in the White House. Branch does portray a helpful distinction in how WJC looked at Whitewater and other scandals. While WJC attacks Whitewater as a political hunt, Branch does have him WJC saying that Filegate needed to be separated from Whitewater, because this was a legitimate inquiry. There are some quips that could catch someone's eye, such as WJC referring to Paula Jones as \"a 'new bimbo' he [WJC] didn't even recognize.\" Branch does not dwell on Lewinsky or the impeachment. With the exception of Bruce, Bennett and Kendall, no other lawyers are mentioned. There is one passage that I am looking into, in which WJC says part of the reason he didn't mention his relationship with Lewinsky at first was because she was being threatened with jail time if she was found to be lying under oath and had he told the truth he could become a witness against her. This is a very small passage that could easily be missed, but one that it is important to note as I don't recall hearing this before. (This is addressed more fully below.) There are a few relationships that track through the book more than others. They include WJC's relationship with Gore, which maps in part because it is not a focal point until the end, and his contentious relationship with Janet Reno. The one Senator that appears to be most discussed negatively is Moynihan. All three of these issues are discussed in turn below. WJC is portrayed as an extremely loving and attentive father and HRC is portrayed in a much more human light than other books/articles covering this time period, with ample mention of her relationship with CVC and images of affection between her and WJC, both pre- and post-impeachment. On foreign relations there is a lot of time spent discussing the Middle East, Northern Ireland, the Balkans, China, Russia, Pakistan/India and in the beginning of the book, Haiti. (Note: Much of what is written about Haiti is about Branch's own experience there and on the subject.) There is also a fair amount of discussion about North Korea, but nothing that has not been discussed in the past few weeks. Bin Laden is discussed in what seems to track mention of him in My Life, which seems to have more detail and background than this book. In certain cases there is more detail here than in My Life, for example on his trip to Pakistan WJC wrote that the USSS cancelled one stop because they would be \"defenseless\" flying in, whereas Brach writes that the streets would be lined with \"assassins.\" There are candid looks at WJC's take on certain people and the relationship between some, such as Albright and Berger's dislike of Holbrooke, and a more detailed depiction of Yeltsin's drinking, such as yelling outside of Blair House for a cab to get pizza. One thing to note, is that often times WJC seems to be speaking to Branch intentionally without the recorders going, but Branch writes about those interactions and exchanges nonetheless. Such is the case with HRC's Gephardt comment. The following items are addressed in the memo: Wen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill 4 WJC and Lewinsky's Silence 4 HRC and Kissinger 4 HRC and gay/lesbian 5 Tension with Moynihan 5 HRC as World Player 5 Jesse Jackson 6 Tension with Janet Reno 6 Portrayal of Carter 7 Relationship with Gore 8 Other (This includes: Maggie recommending Panetta, HRC and Haiti Invasion, ITAV co-author flap, Subpoenas of CVC's Friends, Vernon Jordan on Extramarital Sex, Gore/HRC ticket, WJC suggesting Rubin run for Senate, Trip to South Asia) 11 Wen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill In discussing Wen Ho Lee's release Branch characterizes WJC's lack of knowledge about the strained interpretation of the anti-terrorist provisions in the crime bill and arbitrary detentions as a \"confession.\" My Life only mentions Lee's accusation in passing and does not again discuss Lee. Below are two passages from Branch's book the first giving context and the second about the Terror Clause of the Crime Bill. ➢ The year closed on spies and terrorism. The Justice Department, after fierce debate among the security agencies, indicted nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee on fifty-nine counts of copying classified material to his personal computer. Lee was being handled like a radioactive espionage defendant—no bail, lockdown, solitary confinement—even though the long dragnet had produced no evidence that he offered secrets to China or anyone else. The president said experts were telling him the worst spies sometimes stored their treason for a rainy day. This sounded fishy to me. Clinton shrugged. Nothing would please him more than to establish Lee's innocence. [Branch, 577] ➢ While Lee was indicted, Branch writes that WJC noted that others \"were being held in secret, uncharged and untried...He [WJC] was embarrassed not to have sponsored this measure into law without foreseeing such arbitrary detentions...Under the terrorist act, any prosecutor should decide within the legal limit...whether to bring charges on the testimony of a secret informant or otherwise. To his dismay, Clinton had learned of defendants held incommunicado for more than six months. One extreme detention had last three years. 'I think it's wrong,' he [WJC] said. 'It's not American. We accept guilty people on the street to enjoy and protect our freedom.' [Branch, 629] WJC and Lewinsky's Silence Branch writes that part of WJC's motive for not discussing what had happened with Lewinsky was that it could send her to jail, as she had denied it. ➢ \"Also, he pointed out that Starr had been threatening to jail Lewinsky all year over her sworn denial of the affair. If Clinton had come forward with anything at all about their relationship, he said Starr could have turned him into a witness against Lewinsky, betraying her discreet silence. Such subtleties, while original, struck me as tendentious. The president never claimed chivalry as the real motive for his steadfast denial, nor did he dispute the essential truth of Lewinsky's account.\" [Branch, 511] HRC and Kissinger The following could be fodder for people who want to continue to string along the notion of channeling Eleanor Roosevelt. ➢ There is a passage in which HRC describes an exchange she had with Kissinger at a dinner where he complained that if the health care bill passed he wouldn't be able to see his own doctor. She continued to say \"it was interesting, in fact, that she had dreamed about Kissinger only a few nights before. His visage turned suddenly effervescent at a banquet, announcing gladly that his worries were over because the Clinton health care bill was dying. 'Oh, no, Dr. Kissinger,' she replied coolly. 'Don't be sure that it's dead. We'll keep fighting, and there's always light at the end of the tunnel.' She said Kissing blanched, speechless at her deft reminder of the Vietnam War...Now at last, in Hillary's dream, it registered that his strategic designs had spewed carnage and venom for seven needless years...'That's what I dreamed,' Hillary repeated, lost in thought. 'You know, I always get my revenge in dreams, but never in real life.' [Branch, 179] HRC and gay/lesbian Writing about a call with HRC from NYS, Branch recalls how WJC's counsel got very \"exercised.\" WJC left the room. \"He was subdued on his return. 'You know, I've had a lot more contact with gay people in my life than Hillary.' He sighed. Her temperament had a conservative, religious core, formed before homosexual issues were even mentionable. New York politics was a tough crucible, and she was unsure what heat she could take. On the other hand, personal experience could speed adaptation.\" [Branch, 551] Tension with Moynihan There are several occasions throughout the book that Branch recalls WJC's grievances and frustration with Moynihan. For example: > When Moynihan called for the international arms embargo to be unilaterally lifted so that Bosnia could fight for themselves, Branch writes, \"The president flinched when I mentioned [it]...'That's just a freebie for him,' snapped Clinton, 'and he knows it.'\" [p.140] > In regard to health care: \"Echoing comments by Hillary at dinner, he [WJC] faulted Senator Moynihan for aimless hearings conducted without a strategy or theme.\" [p.170] ➢ Discussing Independent Counsel: \"She [HRC] was especially scornful of the Democrats, and quoted a number of them. Senator Moynihan, for instance, publicly said the Clintons were nice people and he was sure they had nothing to hide. 'Why not have an investigation?' he often asked. She said Moynihan skated blithely on the surface, never produced results in Congress, and could not withstand such scrutiny himself for five minutes, living in an apartment secured through his chairmanship of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation.\" [Brach, 182] ➢ \"Donnybrook\" argument in which Moynihan said of a fundraising speech WJC gave citing a regretted hypothetical about a controversial decision. Moynihan told the press, \"He doesn't understand...that he's conceding the principles.\" WJC confronted him about lack of context given to the statement to the press and said that Moynihan knew what he was doing by \"feeding the beast of hostile presumption about Clinton's motives.\" [Branch, 299] HRC as World Player There are several images as HRC as a player on the world stage, both with WJC and on her own. Several examples follow: ➢ Middle East: Discussing peace with King Hussein: \"They had retreated for lunch as two couples—the Clintons, with the king and his wife, Queen Noor—in the family dining room... Their agenda was a delicate race between Hussein's failing health and his desire to make peace with Israel. The president said he and Hillary pounded away on symptoms of national estrangement: closed boarders, water disputes, travel barriers, war grievances, contested airspace, sealed electrical grids, and so on. Hussein gave them a feast of goodwill without commitment on any point.\" [Branch, 170] > South Asia: Regarding her trip to South Asia with CVC in 1995, \"Her [HRC's] schedule was far more demanding than ceremonial, pushing both conflict resolution and civic empowerment for downtrodden women.\" [Branch, 236] Later Branch tells of Benazir Bhutto praising CVC and HRC. \"By contrast with a superficial American press, which portrayed Hillary as a demure tourist of no policy significance in exotic Asia, Bhutto said she had touched essential political chords with whirlwind encouragements for citizenship groups and small-scale economic development.\" (The note contrasting Bhutto corresponds to a NYT article which Branch quotes in the footer saying, \"she [HRC] played the traditional role of First Lady as wife and mother...\") [Branch, 246] > China Speech: Branch outlines how HRC felt the speech needed to be bigger than China and how she depicted the \"harsh reality everywhere\" from China to Africa. He then cites WJC commenting on the rave reviews of HRC's speech. [Branch, 289] ➢ Regarding the Russian financial system meltdown, Branch writes \"Yeltsin seemed so removed from urgent political tasks that both Clintons counseled him directly.\" [Branch, 512-513] Jesse Jackson Branch writes about Jesse Jackson calling CVC after the Lewinsky story broke and having continued contact with her throughout the period. WJC thanks him for his support of CVC. This goes into some detail about WJCs gratitude, but the fact that Jackson \"counseled\" CVC has been public knowledge dating back to at least 1999. ➢ \"But now Jesse had done something he would not forget. When the Lewinsky news broke, he called Chelsea at Stanford. Jesse was the only nonfamily adult with her cell phone number. How he got it was another story. Jesse said he knew this was terrible for her. Nothing like it had ever happened in American politics. He did not know everything involved, but he wanted to remind Chelsea how much her parents loved her. Their family needed to stick together now above all, and if she needed to counsel, rage, or pray, he was always available.\" [Branch, 497] Tension with Janet Reno Throughout the book, from his nomination of her, WJC is portrayed as having no opinion to having a negative opinion of Janet Reno. > \"He complained about Janet Reno—made it clear, in fact, that he felt alienated from his own attorney general. If he removed her, however, the pending decision on yet another special prosecutor [for 1996 campaign finance] would fall to Reno's deputy, Jamie Gorelick, who, Clinton feared, may share Reno's wholesale devotion to outside control for any case in which the president himself may become a target...If he removed both Reno and Gorelick, to start fresh, it would touch off a firestorm of protest like Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre of the Justice Department officials during the Watergate scandal. That was not an option.\" [Branch, 388-389] > Branch writes about WJC talking about Reno and Louis Freeh disregarding a letter from D'Amato and continuing to allow independent counsel to go after Ciseneros. The same held true for Mike Espy. Branch then outlines a meeting between WJC and Reno. Reno had made public statements about her \"desire to stay on the job. 'I told her I didn't like that one damn bit,' the president said tersely. 'I didn't hire her to work for the New York Times and Washington Post. I hired her to work for me.'\" [Branch, 398] He continues to outline that Clinton did give Reno credit for some good achievements including coordination with U.S. attorneys and that he didn't blame her for the special prosecutor on Whitewater, but that \"he did blame her for abdicating responsibility to supervise the investigations ever since, letting mandates multiply almost at will. She accepted criteria that were ludicrous and crassly partisan. Reno had failed to defend the presidency itself—not Clinton personally, but the institution—and by extension the entire executive branch...He told me she had no clue what he meant. His advisers considered her more naïve than upright, and the fuzziness of the distinction seemed to save her.\" [Branch, 399] He cites that Clinton warned her that she should prepare herself for not staying in the job for the entire second term. Portrayal of Jimmy Carter There are parallels that could be drawn between WJC/BHO and Carter/WJC both in terms of Carter's trip to North Korea and the mission he went on to Haiti. WJC clearly was frustrated by Carter's seeming desire to be on the front lines. North Korea: ➢ \"On North Korea, he [WJC] said Jimmy Carter had initiated his own recent trip with a call to Al Gore, and Clinton had approved the volunteer mission to break through North Korea's extreme isolation... Sure enough, Carter did reach North Korean dictator Kim Il-sung, who proposed to allow inspection of North Korea's nuclear facilities in exchange for relief from the harsh economic sanctions. The only hitch was that Carter announced the terms on CNN before they became official, adding gratuitously that he never had agreed with sanctions in the first place. News stories had the White House seething, but Clinton made light of the spat. He said the deal was since ratified by an exchange of letters, and he did not believe Carter would criticize official policy 'if the game were still in doubt.' [Branch, 162] Haiti: ➢ After pushing to be sent to Haiti and enlisting Colin Powell and Sam Nunn to get WJC to break with Gore (who said Carter shouldn't be trusted a second time) and Christopher and approve the mission to Haiti to seek a truce with the junta, Carter is portrayed as acting stubbornly and having 'clientitis' (arguing for acceptance of Haitian generals versus what was in the United States' best interest). He didn't want to leave and WJC told him he had to. Like after North Korea, Carter again, Carter went to the press first. \"The three negotiators flew back to Washington late Sunday, and Carter, invited to stay over at the White House, called CNN's Judy Woodruff after midnight to arrange an interview the next morning before he reported to Clinton on his mission. This conduct, the president said tersely, was not right...The press was full of retrospective stories about friction between him and his three prominent negotiators...He said the current newsweeklies lapped up criticism by Carter as an embarrassment to Clinton...Many of his advisers griped that Jimmy Carter thought he was still president, but Clinton found this criticism too jaundiced. Carter had spoken with restraint at their joint press conference, he allowed, exhibiting a keen political ear...To Clinton, Carter simply felt that he had earned the right to speak his mind as an international statesman, even about a mission he had accepted for the United States government complete with an Air Force jet. This sense of entitlement could make Carter a thorn, but Clinton thought his value far outweighed the political annoyance. He considered Carter a sterling ex- resident.\" [Branch, 200-201] Dispatch of Bombers Near Iraq ➢ \"He expected military strikes to win bipartisan assent, including former presidents Ford, Reagan and Bush. 'Dole will support me,' he said. 'Carter will probably criticize me. Carter always criticizes, but he doesn't have much positive to say.\" [Branch, 518] Gore For the majority of the book, there is little discussion of WJC and Gore's relationship. There are few places where he is briefly mentioned and a couple of scenes with some levity. The end, however, describes the seemingly brutally candid conversation between the two about the 2000 election and the impeachment. ➢ On page 92 Branch writes, \"No, he [Clinton] did not ask Gore to take over a failed foreign policy, as alleged, but to improve public presentations by his troika of 'bad talkers': shy National Security Adviser Tony Lake, boring Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and disorganized Defense Secretary Les Aspin.\" [Branch, 92] ➢ In one-passage WJC talks about asking Gore to lead the independent review of Hazel O'Leary and also having Gore substitute for him at an economic conference in Japan. The latter did not fare well as other nations were offended that Gore, not WJC attended. Gore insisted that WJC needed to go to Japan to redeem himself and the administration for his absence. Gore pointed to a few days in January, but WJC \"pronounced them vital to Chelsea's schoolwork. Gore blinked. So what?...Mutual exasperation spiked. `Al,' Clinton told him, 'I am not going to Japan and leave Chelsea by herself to take these exams.' Gore erupted. He thought Clinton had lost his bearing. They had a big fight, said the president, and were still wrangling about dates for Japan.\" Branch states that this fight wound up being around the time WJC saw Lewinsky. [Branch, 316-317] ➢ On page 396-397 there is a scene, which shows Gore's sense of humor and Gore, WJC, et al working as a team to secure the Cabinet for the second term. ➢ Later there is a passage about an exchange between WJC and HRC about Gore trying to hire a second criminal lawyer. HRC already knew he was paying the first one $30,000 per month. The conversation is about a leak of an offer from Jim Neal of TN, the former Watergate prosecutor to defend Gore for free. The exchange is more on ethics of the offer and its leak to the press than about Gore. ➢ On Gore's announcing his campaign. \"The president had called twice to congratulate Gore for his kickoff events—once from Geneva, hours later from Paris. Clinton thought the only glitches were technical... But Gore got all the big things right. His twofold message was perfect: distinguish himself from Clinton's personal flaws, and tell voters exactly what he would do for them in the White House. The president said it was fine for Gore to call Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky 'inexcusable.' First, it was true. Second, it showed a necessary strength to criticized the boss. Third, Gore would be badgered to death until he did. 'Al,' Clinton told him, 'if you thought it would help in the campaign, I would let you flog me at noon right on the doorstep of the Washington Post.'\" [Branch, 553-554] Branch continues that WJC told Gore to ignore reporting that he was offended or critical of his campaign. \"On tape, the president said he confided his chief strategic worry only to Gore himself and to Gore's pollster, Mark Penn. The vice president must project his platform—where he stood, precisely how and where he would lead the country—because the Republicans would try to knock him off substance.\" [Branch, 554] ➢ WJC offered critiques of Gore's campaign throughout, but it was always framed as his fear of Gore not succeeding him. For example, \"Clinton still thought Gore could win. Most people considered him smart, experience, and motivated. He examined the pitfalls for Gore in a campaign showcasing presidential character over detailed agendas for the country. Reporters called Gore \"stiff,\" but Clinton discounted this liability. He thought Gore's droll sense of humor would wear well over time. Gore also was perceived to be too conventional a Democrat, therefore lacking independence, which called for Gore to emphasize more his own passion and initiatives. Then the president said Gore could have a brooding quality about him, not worrisome or off-putting in itself, but potentially damaging if his serious nature failed to give voters a lifted. Clinton isolated the word \"sunny.\" Gore needed more of it.\" [Branch, 599] ➢ He also complimented Gore's knowledge of government workings. \"Gore knew Washington. Believe me, said the president, his administration would have made many more errors in the first two years had it not been for the vice president.\" He then goes on to say that WJC suggested Gore find someone who would be a bright spot to run with, perhaps Durbin or Bradley or Kerrey, although he also goes into great detail about the virtues of Mikulski, even though she would never get chosen. How much of this was WJC's emphasis versus Branch's focus on his home state senator is unclear. [Branch, 599, 618-19] ➢ WJC criticized Gore for not running on the successes of the administration. \"They should be running essentially for a third term, said the president, but they were afraid the Clinton-Gore record would tarnish them with Clinton's character.\" [Branch, 623] Branch gives WJC's critique of Gore in debate that had been heard before—that Gore lacked style and a light touch. ➢ Branch has WJC recalling a conversation between WJC and Gore where \"Gore had bared himself in one of their stressful consultations by insisting that he, Gore, was a good politician, elaborating that he meant good on the policy, and also good on the politics, but admitted that he did not instinctively blend the two. Gore said he had to think about it, and Clinton thought this was pretty close to the bone...He had the stuff to be a great president, and this was the message that Clinton must convey somehow without seeming to brag on his own record.\" [Branch, 623-624] ➢ The big passage about Gore begins on page 641 and extends to 645. Branch notes that WJC was unsure at first about recording the details. At the outset it says, \"For his own part, Gore was not angry, nor did he blame Clinton for his defeat, but he wanted to acknowledge forthrightly that some people around him did.\" [Branch, 642] It has WJC acknowledging that Gore's use of him was proper—he was best in the White House. Then he says, \"'I think you made a mistake not to use me more in the last ten days,'\" Clinton told Gore, 'but otherwise that was not a big deal. I was much more upset about your message, now that we're being honest.'\" [Branch, 642] Branch recalls WJC saying Gore fought bag saying that \"Clinton's drag plagued every direction.\" Clinton then said that Gore was better at governance than Clinton, and Gore would be better for the nation than Bush, and that he was an \"unparalleled\" vice president, but that he had \"blind spots.\" Branch writes that WJC kept saying their confrontation was \"surreal.\" o Gore had a \"fresh grievance...he wanted Clinton to know that the Buddhist temple fund-raising scandal had been the worst experience of his life. No one had ever questioned his personal integrity, but corrosive publicity and whispers had tormented him now for four years. Gore said he had not been disposed to blame Clinton. However, he remembered telling the president that he found himself the only English-speaking person at one of those Asian fund-raisers. And the president was in charge of the party apparatus that was supposed to screen all the donations for trouble. So he did blame Clinton in a way. The president told me he could scarcely believe the ensuing tales of suspicion. Gore must still be in shock from the election, or unhinged. 'I thought he was in Neverland,' he said.\" [Branch, 643-644] o Branch continues: \"The vice president asked Clinton about Monica Lewinsky. He had supported Clinton all through the impeachment, publicly and privately, while declaring himself disappointed. Yes, said the president. He appreciated that. However, persisted Gore, Clinton did not confide any personal feelings. He never explained exactly what happened. There was little to say, Clinton replied, beyond failure and regret. He was humiliated and angry, had made mistake. He had misled the American people, and he was sorry. Gore closed his point with emphasis. Well, he said, this is the first time you have apologized to me personally. Clinton did a double take...Gore treated the confession as a watershed. Their colliding perspectives made both of them angry. Clinton exploded that Gore's reaction was phony. What was so significant here?...Gore exploded back. He was feeling a stubborn repeat of the defensiveness and delayed honesty that somehow cost the election. Clinton's character was at the root of it...\" [Branch, 644-45] Other ➢ Maggie as Person Recommending Panetta: Unlike in My Life, in Branch's book, it has WJC asking Maggie to compile confidential suggestions for McLarty's replacement. \"Williams was shrewd, discreet, and efficient.\" [Branch, 161] > HRC and Haiti Invasion: Branch asked WJC what HRC thought about his foreign policy team's suggestion to invade Haiti. \"He said the pell-mell rush to invade was crazy to her. Reacting against the pressure, the lack of options, and his sense of being trapped, she said he was badly served by his foreign policy staff. He said she observed with some suspicion that the chief sponsors of the invasion—Lake, Berger, and Talbott—were the same people who had pushed the ill-fated appointment of Bobby Ray Inman as defense secretary.\" [Branch, 189] > ITAV: ITAV co-author flap in which Sally Quinn spread rumors that HRC had not written the book. Quinn said that HRC had denied credit to the book's collaborator, Barbara Feinman, a friend of Quinn. HRC said Feinman had withdrawn from the project. Branch notes that the White House had draft chapters in HRC's handwriting. (Branch turned this to be about him and how it affected him as a ghostwriter.) From this HRC said that Quinn and her friends launched a rumor that HRC and a female veterinarian of Socks' were \"discovered...in flagrante on a bedroom floor in the White House.\" [Branch, 342-343] > Subpoenas of CVC's Friends: Branch tells of how D'Amato, as Chair of the Banking Committee, had subpoenaed all those who might have been in the White House when HRC's Rose firm records were there. This included \"some two dozen of Chelsea's sleepovers.\" Senator Sarbanes quashed the subpoenas for the sleepovers. [Branch, 362] ➢ Vernon Jordan Extramarital Sex: In the context of Lewinsky, Branch says of Vernon Jordan, \"In our glancing associations, I had picked up from Vernon an attitude toward extramarital sex best described as lighthearted or recreational.\" [Branch, 495] > Gore/HRC ticket: \"By the numbers, and Clinton's gut, a Gore-Hillary ticket would give Democrats their best chance to defeat Bush for the White House. 'Hands down,' he [WJC] said, tut I don't think Al would ever do it.'\" [Branch, 540] > WJC suggesting Rubin run for NY Senate seat: The passage comes after WJC talks about supporting HRC if she decided to run, which raises a question of whether he had preferred Rubin or whether the two events are unconnected. \"When the president had urged him [Rubin] to run for and easily win the New York Senate seat, Rubin recoiled...He could not fathom why Hillary wanted to run now...\" [Branch, 557] ➢ On trip to South Asia: Branch says that WJC agreed to cancel a stop in Bangladesh, because \"of hard intelligence that Osama bin Laden had lined the route with assassins.\" [Branch, 594] My Life discusses the cancelled trip but does not specify it was because of bin Laden or assassins. DI 'Gephardt is an asshole,\" Hillary commented. The president, pointing to my recorders, advised gently that the tapes were on. She winced but shrugged with a smile. \"Well, he is,\" she insisted. In an awkward silence, I backed up both machines to erase the first lady's epithet.\" [Branch, 263]"

President Barack Obama's announcement of a new system.for protecting America's allies against Iranian missiles has ignited charges that he is scaling back the one he inherited from George W. Bush as a concession to the Russians. In fact, the Obama plan is a big improvement on the Bush one, and it is designed to counter an evolving Iranian threat, not to mollify Russian anxieties. Mr Bush's decision to put 10 missile interceptors in Poland and an associated radar in the Czech Republic was based on a concern that Iran was developing long-range rockets that could hit the US. The Bush system would have been less effective against shorter- range Iranian missiles, and it would have left much of Europe, notably including America's ally Turkey, unprotected. Over the last several years, the Iranians have shifted their efforts from developing a few long-range rockets to deploying large numbers of shorter-range ones that pose an immediate danger to southeastern Europe and the Middle East, as well as to US forces stationed there. Unlike Mr Bush's, Mr Obama's plan will quickly field a missile-defence capability to address an existing threat. It can be upgraded to deal with longer-range Iranian missiles in the future. The Central Europeans who have reacted to the decision with apprehension or alarm should recognize that the replacement of a conceptually flawed plan with a more credible one strengthens the bonds of transatlantic defence. The view from Moscow has been clouded by outright paranoia. Military experts there suspected that the US rockets in Poland, while advertised as defensive, could be used offensively, even pre-emptively, against Russia. Laying to rest that far-fetched scenario was not the prime motivation for Mr Obama's decision, nor should it have been. However, by removing what has been a gratuitous irritant in bilateral relations, the president has improved the prospects for US-Russian arms control negotiations now underway in Geneva. Those talks could produce by December a new treaty reducing numbers of strategic - that is, intercontinental — weapons. If ratified by the US Senate (which will not be easy, given the ferocity of the partisan wars in Washington), the US and Russia will be on track for further reductions in the future. Mr Obama and Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, who are due to meet in New York this week, have jointly called for the eventual goal of eliminating nuclear weapons. As they and their successors take steps in that direction, they will have to grapple with a stark paradox of the nuclear age: mutual deterrence depends on each side being vulnerable to retaliation from the other. If either side has enough defences to trump the other side's offence, the mutuality of deterrence breaks down and one or both sides will be on hair-trigger, making war more likely in a crisis. American statesmen pounded this inescapable truth into the heads of their initially sceptical Soviet counterparts 40 years ago. The result was the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty signed by Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev in 1972. By limiting the defensive capability of both superpowers, the ABM treaty was a necessary companion piece to a series of treaties setting ceilings on offensive weaponry. Because nuclear weapons were expected to with us forever, the ABM treaty was meant to last in perpetuity. While the Soviets were converted to the logic of restricting defence, Ronald Reagan was not. The late US president championed the development of a space-based comprehensive shield that would make offensive weapons — and therefore mutual deterrence — \"impotent and obsolete.\" Many experts believed Reagan's vision, which they derisively nicknamed Star Wars, was an impossible dream. So did his successor, George H. W. Bush, who treated the program with benign neglect while negotiating with the Russians in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) begun by Mr Reagan. The second president Bush reversed his father's policy. He greatly weakened the START process, pulled the US out of the ABM treaty and sought to revive a national missile defence (NMD) system. His decision to build the interceptor and radar sites in Poland and the Czech Republic was, as one of his aides told me at the time, in large measure about \"pouring concrete for what will eventually be a global NMD.\" Key officials of the Obama administration — including the president himself, who studied arms control in college — understand the linkage between reduction of offences and regulation of defences. However, they have avoided raising that issue in the context of last week's decision. That is partly because they want their plan to be judged on its own merits, vis-à-vis the Iranian threat. But it is because they have more than enough fights with the Republicans without further energizing the right wing by trying to reinstate the principles of the ABM treaty. Yet sooner or later the US administration will have to grasp the nettle of regulating strategic defences. Otherwise, continued reductions in strategic nuclear offences will be either impossible or, worse, dangerous. The author is president of the Brookings Institution."

"C05770166"	"Top 2 Civilians Face Rockiness in Afghan Shift By MARK LANDLER The New York Times Thu, July 1, 2010 WASHINGTON — As General David H. Petraeus takes command in Afghanistan, the two top American civilian officials in the war face an uncertain and tricky future, working with a newly empowered military leader, under the gaze of an impatient president who has put them on notice that his fractious war council needs to pull together. Richard C. Holbrooke, the Obama administration's special representative to the region, and Karl W. Eikenberry, the ambassador to Afghanistan, both hung on to their jobs in the uproar that followed Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal's career- ending quotes in Rolling Stone magazine. But privately, at least one senior White House official suggested using General McChrystal's exit as an excuse for a housecleaning, according to senior officials. That was rejected as too disruptive during a military campaign that relies heavily on civilian support, these people said. In recent days, other administration officials have begun floating the idea that Ambassador Eikenberry might be replaced by Ryan C. Crocker, the highly regarded former ambassador in Iraq who forged a close partnership with General Petraeus during the successful Iraq troop increase. Such a prospect is viewed as remote, given Mr. Crocker's prestigious new post at Texas A&M University. But the fact that his name is being invoked underlines the challenges that confront Ambassador Eikenberry, as he adapts to a new partner — one who has strong ideas about how soldiers and diplomats should work together in war. It also illustrates the remarkably powerful role that General Petraeus will assume in the nine-year-old war, setting him up as almost a viceroy in Afghanistan and a key broker in negotiations between President Hamid Karzai and Pakistan over an eventual political settlement. Prior to General Petraeus's arrival, some critics said the White House had created a problem by recruiting several forceful, ambitious personalities and giving them jobs with overlapping responsibilities. Administration officials acknowledge that, as one said, \"There are obviously a number of substantial personalities on the team.\" But the White House believes that the current lineup can mesh, and that a difficult war demands this much talent. Still, the McChrystal blow-up has reverberated through the State Department. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton instructed Ambassador Eikenberry and Mr. Holbrooke to take a hard look at the civilian team, two officials said. She is not wedded to the current lineup if it continues to bog down in internecine battles, they said. \"You can't have a major shift in a civ-mil structure without having the civilian side take a step back and look at everything,\" said a senior State Department official, using the jargon for a civilian-military campaign. Be General Petraeus, whose appointment was approved 99-0 by the Senate on Wednesday, took pains at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday to back a unified civilian and military effort. He noted then that he had telephoned Mr. Holbrooke and would rendezvous with Ambassador Eikenberry in Brussels, so the two could land in Kabul together. \"Holbrooke has been my wingman, to a great degree,\" General Petraeus said in an interview. \"We have had, and do have, a very good relationship.\" That role, he said, will now fall to Ambassador Eikenberry. Ambassador Eikenberry was highly critical of the Pentagon's proposal last year to send 60,000 additional troops to Afghanistan, which led to a difficult relationship with General McChrystal. But in fact General Petraeus was the true architect of the plan. The ambassador, a retired lieutenant general and former commander in Afghanistan, graduated from West Point in 1973, a year ahead of General Petraeus, but they did not know each other at the academy. The two share a scholarly bent: General Petraeus holds a Ph.D. from Princeton, while Ambassador Eikenberry has Master's degrees from Harvard and Stanford. While they were never assigned together, their careers intersected twice. In Iraq, General Eikenberry led an assessment of Iraqi security forces while General Petraeus was commanding the 101st Airborne Division in Mosul. When General Eikenberry was commander in Afghanistan, General Petraeus led an assessment of Afghan National Security Forces. General Petraeus declined to discuss personnel issues, while Ambassador Eikenberry and Mr. Holbrooke turned down requests for an interview. Mr. Crocker, now the dean of the George Bush School of Government at Texas A&M, did not return a call for comment. For Mr. Holbrooke, the new landscape is challenging in other ways. Officials said his job security was less in doubt than it was six months ago, when his ouster was the subject of endless Washington chatter. Yet he has arguably become a less central player: Jacob J. Lew, a deputy secretary of state, manages much of the civilian influx in Afghanistan that Mr. Holbrooke helped shape, while the embassy in Kabul is carrying it out. Mr. Holbrooke's current portfolio has played to his weaknesses, his own allies admit. He is best as a high-level negotiator, and not as comfortable with the nitty-gritty work of helping Afghanistan build an economy. These days, Mr. Holbrooke has become a globe-trotting diplomat, trying to retain flagging European allies while seeking to draw influential Muslim countries like Egypt into helping Afghanistan. At a recent conference of 35 countries in Madrid, Mr. Holbrooke drummed up more support from allies for the Afghan government's campaign to reintegrate Taliban fighters into mainstream society. Mr. Karzai's longer-term effort to reconcile with Taliban leaders, and his negotiations with Pakistan, could propel Mr. Holbrooke back into a central role. Were these talks to become more serious, several officials said, Mr. Holbrooke's negotiating skills could be put to use, as a broker and guardian of American interests. For now, though, as evidence of General Petraeus's influence, he will do most of the shuttling between Kabul and Islamabad. On his last visit to the region, Mr. Holbrooke met with Mr. Karzai and with senior Pakistani officials, including the army chief of staff, Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. Mr. Holbrooke's past run-ins with Mr. Karzai, several officials said, have not hindered his ability to deal with the Afghan leader, and Pakistani officials said they trusted him. Husain Haqqani, Pakistan's ambassador to Washington, said that Mr. Holbrooke took time to understand Pakistan's concerns. \"Ambassador Holbrooke is liked by some, admired by others and seen as effective, even by those who may not like him,\" Mr. Haqqani said. Still, General Petraeus is indisputably the key player, and he has wasted no time asserting his control. On a secure videoconference call last Saturday, a person familiar with the call said, General Petraeus threw his support behind a costly, and controversial, plan to install temporary generators to supply more electricity to Kandahar, the Taliban stronghold that is the next major American military target. Mr. Holbrooke and Ambassador Eikenberry swiftly assented."

During the trial runs last week, the Chinese expo-goers rushed directly from the gates to the USAP (and even broke some of our turn-styles). Needless to say, the Chinese have improved security. On EACH of the first two days, 30,000 pple visited. Lines are long and pple are loving the show. We are also getting many foreign officials to visit. -the 100 US college student ambassadors (who act as guides and speak Mandarin) are the biggest hits of the pavilion. Fair-goers stand in line to have their photo's taken w them. They explain the show and send a great message. - the story line that we thght was simplistic is quite popular (the overture where Americans try to say hello in mandarin is met w howls of laughter and Act ll called the Garden is doing well).

Furthermore, the government of Afghanistan must demonstrate that corruption is being aggressively investigated and prosecuted. \"Rampant corruption fosters the conditions that threaten the security of our troops and the stability of the Afghan government and economy.\" The State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee will mark up its Fiscal Year 2011 Appropriations Act on Wednesday June 30th. The subcommittee will not consider any bilateral assistance for the Afghan government other than lifesaving humanitarian aid at this time. Lowey also announced the Subcommittee will hold oversight hearings after the July 4th recess to get to the bottom of these allegations. \"Too many Americans are suffering in this economy for us to put their hard-earned tax dollars into the hands of criminals overseas,\" said Lowey. \"We will not commit billions more in taxpayer money for Afghanistan until there are assurances that such funds will be used for their intended purposes and that the government of Afghanistan is willing and able to root corruption within its ranks. U.S. taxpayers deserve nothing less.\""

"C05771695"	"sbwhoeor Sunday, September 19, 2010 11:18 PM H: Richard Medley has sent this around in his private newsletter. Sid US Election And The Fed Welcome To The New (Old) World September 19, 2010 One of the main debates inside senior Fed offices is how much they may have to balance a much more conservative fiscal policy if the Republicans take over. This is the most important question facing officials on both sides of the fence (far more than squiggles and whirls of monthly numbers). But it's not just spending and taxes, important as they are, it's also implementation of Reg Reform and Health Care Reform. All of that is going to change after November. Here are the details. Amid the snarkiness about how crazy the Tea Party candidates may be (and, as you know, we LOVE snarkiness) two things should not be lost: 1. The President has lost control of the spending and tax agenda 2. The President has lost control of implementing the Reg Reform and health care legislation Congress pushed through. All polling from both parties and independent sources point strongly to the Republicans taking over the House. Although they are less likely to take over the Senate, they will be able to gain effective control of spending, taxes and large scale administrative reforms. Let's start with spending: The basic fact is that all spending has to be approved by Congress and it starts with the House. As we wrote nearly a week ago, House Republican Leader Boehner and his senior staff have made it clear to us that they would like to freeze spending at 2008 levels with an annual cost savings of $340 billion. This will be one of the top Republican priorities. Freezing spending at 2008 levels will not happen. However, even in the unlikely event the Republicans do not take over the House the budget will -- at most -- be frozen at or near FY 2010 levels (i.e. the last time money was formally appropriated). Since there have been no spending bills approved and the fiscal year starts in October, the Congress has to pass a \"continuing resolution\" that keeps the government running until specific appropriations are made (the 1995 government shutdown happened because there were no appropriations and no continuing resolution...the government literally runs out of spending authority). Congress will pass a CR in the next few weeks and it will most likely run through the formation of the new Congress (say February or March) next year. They could only do it through the lame duck session, but that would be cutting it close and too cute. Because the new Congress - even if the Republicans fail to take full control of the House - will be dominated by fiscal conservatives, Boehner's CR idea will have traction. The Senate will make it more moderate, but then it will be up to the President to veto it and thus shut down government or sign it and take the hit. In turn that does two things: (1) it frees up money for the Bush tax rollovers and (2) it helps the plan to slow or freeze implementation of the reg reform and health care reform bills. The first part is obvious. The second may be less so. People forget that implementation of these rules requires staff increases, staff reg writing, etc and that's money. By freezing spending at previous levels you freeze the ability to hire new staff and you seriously obstruct the new rule writing process. Add to that Boehner's commitment to overturn the two major regulatory reforms and you've got a tidal wave of indecision and paralysis (Jesus, talk about mixed metaphors although it would be interesting to see one of those). The hearings he will announce and simply the chilling effect of him threatening to overturn the laws will accomplish ninety-percent of what he wants to get done, and potentially give the courts time to strike down parts of the health care bill now under appeal. THE SENATE While everyone has written off Republican control of the Senate (we haven't), the attention should be on what the Senate will look like even if the consensus of 52-54 Democratic majority prevails. The point is how the US Senate will function in January 2011 given its new membership. We got a glimpse of what this would look like when moderate Republican Scott Brown was elected and the health care public option was panned and Reg Reform was trimmed around the edges. The incoming crop of members are much more ardent on government spending, the debt, taxes and regulatory oversight. They will make Boehner's job much easier Take a quick look at the new members (and the several they will marry up with once they are sworn into office). While some of these candidates are replacing Republican open seats, all of them are generally considered more conservative than their predecessors: 1. ck (CO) - likely winner 2. Toomey (PA) - likely winner 3. Rubio (FL) - likely winner 4. Ayotte (NH) - likely winner 5. Blunt (MO) - likely winner 6. Portman (OH) -likely winner 7. Coats (IN) - likely winner 8. Paul (KY) - likely winner 9. Miller (AK) - likely winner 10. Lee (UT) - likely winner 11. Boozman (AR) - likely winner 12. Hoeven (ND) - likely winner 13. Kirk (IL) - 50/50 (lean GOP) 14. Angle (NV) - 50/50 tossup There are several other Democrat-controlled seats that remain in play (CA, WI, WA, and CT). These races continue to develop and we will report more as the picture on Election Day becomes clearer. These likely new members will join the following traditional budget trouble-makers in the US Senate: 1. DeMint (SC) 2. Coburn (OK) 3. Inhofe (OK) 4. McConnell (KY) 5. Kyl (AZ) 6. McCain (AZ) 7. Thune (SD) 8. Crapo (ID) 9. Vitter (LA) 10. Burr (NC) One aggressive Senator can slow the body to a snail's pace, and Republicans operated efficiently as a minority party with only 41 votes total. In January, there will be at least 22 new and existing serious road blocks now patrolling the Senate Floor. The Republican pick-ups will make getting to 60 votes for cloture impossible on spending bills. Welcome to the new reality."

"C05765732"	"Hillary: This is the most provocative and significant analysis to come out of the recent election. Its author is a right-wing Republican lawyer based in Richmond who also writes a column for Human Events. I disagree with the ideological and partisan undercurrent of the piece, especially his overemphasis of the deficit as an overriding political factor rather than the administration's lack of achievable results so far in improving the living standards of ordinary people. There is no reason why the deficit shouldn't become a merely abstract factor once there are actual benefits delivered. The pattern of the past is that the deficit, the talisman of Hoover Republicans, moves only partisan Republicans and that Democrats ascend if the economy is progressing, its gains are widely spread and new social programs have favorable universal impact. That is not happening now. This analysis, therefore, may be portentous. Worth reading. The electoral maps of VA don't show up in the email but they are described. Sid Return to the Article November 13, 2009 Can the Clinton Coalition Survive Obama? By Sean Trende John Judis and Ruy Teixeira's well-regarded 2002 work The Emerging Democratic Majority begins with a vignette set in Virginia. They tell the story of a telecom executive named Mark Warner, who runs a moderate campaign that appeals to upper-middle class suburbanites and working class rural voters, and manages to put together a winning coalition that, if imitated in other states, might put the Democrats in power for decades to come. Democrats did build coalitions similar to Warner's, and in fact had been doing so for the better part of a decade. Warner's coalition was essentially Bill Clinton's 1996 coalition. The coalition and brand that Clinton built was an extraordinarily successful one for Democrats, breaking the momentum of a resurgent GOP in 1996, and ultimately enabling the election of the most liberal President in American History last year. Given this background, it's only appropriate that the first tangible sign that this coalition is coming unglued has come in Virginia. Republican Bob McDonnell won the governorship with almost 59% of the vote — the highest percentage (though not the highest victory margin) for any governor since 1961. The entire Republican ticket won by similar margins, and the GOP picked up six seats in the General Assembly. It could have been even worse — five Democrats won their Assembly races by fewer than 1,000 votes. There are some superficial lessons to be drawn here. After last week's election, it's silly to argue that the GOP brand is too damaged for them to take advantage of Democratic weakness. And the Democrats' latest spin — that their weakness among Independents was simply a function of more Republicans calling themselves independents but retaining their Republican voting habits — puts the lie to the argument that Republicans' low self-identification is a salient factor in elections. But the most important lesson is this: while there's little predictive value in off-year elections, they do provide snapshots of the mood of the electorate, and the present state of political coalitions. Given Virginia's primacy in the story of Democratic coalition building, it gives us a good snapshot of the state of that coalition. And it's not a pretty one for Democrats. The historical base of the Democratic Party for two centuries has long been what Jay Cost and I call Jacksonians: Culturally conservative, hawkish, and populist whites located throughout the South and Border states. They began breaking away from Democrats in the 1950s and 1960s — their reaction to the Party's embrace of unions, blacks and liberals is a story is so well known there's no need to rehash it here. But this group remained at least in play for the Democrats. Clinton inherited a coalition consisting of minorities, liberals, urban voters, and a decent remnant of Jacksonian voters in the Ohio River Valley and the South, who still preferred a moderate-to-conservative Democrat to a Republican. This coalition became a majority coalition when Clinton used a combination of fiscal conservatism and social moderation to bring suburban voters on board. This was a huge innovation for Democrats; suburbs like Nassau County, NY, Orange County, CA and Fairfax County, VA had fueled the rise of the Republican parties in those states. Clinton moved them substantially toward his side. This coalition allowed him to win by eight points in 1996; absent Perot and a last-minute fundraising scandal, he probably would have won by more. Clinton intuited that suburban voters are, generally speaking, culturally cosmopolitan — they don't like it when you call someone \"macaca,\" and aren't crazy about the religious right. But they're generally not particularly socially liberal either, and are fans of \"law and order.\" They like taxes low and appreciate economic growth, but like good schools and a clean environment. Having to balance a bunch of spending priorities with somewhat limited income in their daily lives, balanced budgets are the ultimate \"good government\" indicator for these voters. Clinton delivered on all of these issues, keeping tax increases fairly small, and balancing the budget for much of his term. In so doing — and this is very important — he re-branded the Democrats as the party of fiscal responsibility, economic growth, moderate taxes, and smart government. In other words, he finally shed the \"Carter\" label for the Democrats. This, in turn, made it plausible for his much more liberal heirs to benefit from this presumption of competence for Democrats - one that they probably would not have enjoyed without him. George W. Bush's presidency, in turn, was an upper-middle class suburbanite's nightmare. An aggressive social agenda, a fiscal trainwreck, two poorly-managed wars and a financial collapse later, these suburban voters trended even more heavily Democratic then they were in the Clinton era. By 2008, Democrats held most of the suburban districts around , major metropolitan areas, and were threatening in the exurbs. The right Democratic candidate probably could have put together a massive 2008 Presidential majority, combining minorities, liberals, Jacksonians, Catholics, and suburbanites. The mood of the country was certainly right for a 1920/1932/1952/1980 result. But the Democrats nominated Barack Obama. The party's grip among Jacksonians had weakened since Clinton left the stage, but they abandoned Obama completely. Jay Cost and I have detailed this here. This movement is why Obama received 53% of the vote, instead of the 60% or so we might expect given the voters' attitude toward Bush's Presidency. Obama was able to win even without this branch of the Democratic party because he generated such intensity among the remaining portions of his base. In other words, while his base wasn't as broad as Clinton's, it was deeper. Faced with vanishing 401ks and home values, and disgust with Bush's presidency, suburbanites flocked to him. Liberals were enthralled to finally elect one of their own. And minorities turned out heavily for the opportunity to elect the first black President. But this presents a problem. You only get to elect the first black President once, and governing a coalition of suburbanites, poor blacks, and upper class liberals isn't easy. It is hard to keep that enthusiasm up. And with the Jacksonian wing of the party gone, if that enthusiasm dissipates, or if one of the coalition groups becomes disgruntled and starts to shuffle out the door, the party isn't left with much. We see a microcosm of this story in last Tuesday's elections, especially in Virginia. Let's backtrack to 2001, and look at the counties that Mark Warner won. The coalition that Warner built was similar to Clinton's. To oversimplify some, it blended together rural Democrats in the mining counties in the west of the state, college voters around Charlottesville, and black voters combined with rural whites in the south central and southeastern portion of the state with suburban voters in the northeast. It was a diverse coalition, but it worked. Now let's compare Warner's map with Obama's map in 2008: The suburbs stayed in the Democrat's camp, for reasons discussed above. But look what happens in the west! That area becomes solidly Republican. Buchanan and Dickenson counties in the Virginia panhandle voted for Dukakis, Mondale, and Adlai Stevenson (twice). Obama became only the second Democrat to lose these counties since the UMW moved in during the 1920s. As I said, this isn't a problem so long as (1) the Jacksonians show a willingness to come back for a candidate other than Obama and/or (2) the suburbs continue their love affair with the Democrats. But we see indications in Virginia that the Jacksonian divorce may, in fact, be permanent. Creigh Deeds was from the western section of the state, and seemed — at least on paper — capable of remaking the Mark Warner map. It didn't happen, obviously. Let's look at how Virginia changed from Bush's 2000 election to Deeds' loss last week: The redder a county is, the more it moved toward the Republicans from 2000 to 2009; bluer counties moved toward Democrats. We see that McDonnell did as well as Bush did in the suburbs — but no better. Those pockets of white are the DC suburbs in the northeast, the Hampton Roads area in the southeast, and Richmond just to the north and west of Hampton Roads. Its rural Virginia — which is still about 1/3 of the electorate — that made the difference between Bush's 54% in 2004 and McDonnell's 59% on Tuesday. Even with Obama off the ticket, and a much less cosmopolitan figure atop the ticket, rural Virginia went solidly Republican. We can take another angle here. Deeds and McDonnell squared off in a very close Attorney General race in 2005. Let's compare Deeds' 2005 showing to his 2009 performance. [NOTE: In this map, we look at \"relative movement.\" Because everything in the state moved toward McDonnell, a map just showing \"movement\" would be solid dark red, and not of much use. So instead, if something moved more than 9 points toward McDonnell, it is colored a shade of red, if it moved less than 9 points toward McDonnell, it is blue. Think of this as showing the change in the counties' PVI]. We see the same result. Just since 2005, rural Virginia has moved sharply against the Democrats. The suburbs haven't moved much at all, relative to the rest of the state, while the more heavily African American counties in the southern portion of the state have moved a few notches leftward (in absolute terms, they voted in 2009 as they had in 2005). This suggests lasting damage to the Democratic brand here that is not simply personal to Obama. Now let's look at how McDonnell did when compared to McCain in 2008. Again, because the movement here was so dramatic statewide, we need to isolate the biggest and smallest changes by looking only at \"relative\" shifts. The western counties of the state didn't shift much from 2008, but that's because they were already giving Republicans around 70% of the vote — there wasn't much room for Republican growth (and remember, \"blue\" in a relative map still means slight movement toward the Republican since 2008)! The real Republican gains over the past year have come in the DC exurbs, in the 1-95 corridor, and to a lesser extent in the Hampton Roads area. In other words, the Jacksonians aren't returning to the Democrats, at least in Virginia. Deeds might still have been able to win without them, but the Democrats are also showing weakness in the Virginia suburbs. In other words, two pieces of the Clinton-Warner coalition are starting to break away. This is a real problem for the Democrats. If the suburbanites and the Jacksonians move away from the party, there is very, very little left for them. And there's reason to think that the suburban weakness is real. Obama's fiscal policy, to make an understatement, hasn't been Clintonian. It may not be entirely his fault, but the $787 billion stimulus, the trillion dollar healthcare bill, the automobile bailout, and the budget showing trillion dollar deficits extending for the next decade make suburbanites shudder. They don't much like debt, and they intuit this spending is going to have to be paid for at some point — probably by them. Voters still give Obama some benefit of the doubt, as they do most Presidents in their first year, but they are becoming very, very worried, and probably don't put much stock in Candidate Obama's promise to enact a net spending cut any more. Democrats will doubtless chalk this up to Creigh Deeds' inept campaign. Deeds wasn't a great candidate, but when the mood of the country is starting to swing against your party, it is hard to run a good campaign. Jerry Kilgore found this out when he ran in a similar environment in 2005, and was reduced to attacking Tim Kaine for his religious views on the death penalty. And if you run the Deeds-McDonnell race in 2006 or 2008, I think its hard to argue McDonnell would win by 18 points, even holding everything else equal. The other problem with this explanation is that we saw similar results replicated around the country. Most of the seats in the House of Delegates that the Democrats lost in Virginia, or came close to losing, were suburban. The Philly suburbs voted Republican for the state Supreme Court. Bergen County New Jersey didn't give the Republican 60% of the vote like it did in 1984, but Chris Christie nearly carried it, and even though he is significantly more conservative than Christie Todd Whitman or Tom Kean, he won the largest margin for a first-term Republican Governor since 1969. Conservative Republicans won elections in Westchester County, New York, and Republicans picked up two City Council seats on the outskirts of Queens. Republicans won back the Nassau County legislature -- the Democrats' capture of that body figures prominently in the introduction to Emerging Democratic Majority -- and nearly defeated the Democratic County Executive there with an obscure, underfunded candidate. In other words, in places that have never heard of Creigh Deeds or seen his attack ads on McDonell's thesis, the Democrats still lost suburban voters. States with a Democratic base of liberals, urbanites, and minority voters -- like California and New York -- haven't moved much against Democrats. Obama's polling numbers, as well as those of Democratic candidates for Governor and Senator, in classic \"Emerging Democratic Majority\" states like Colorado and Nevada are not looking good at all. And of course in Jacksonian states like Kentucky, he's below 40%. This doesn't mean that Democrats are doomed in 2010. An improved economy, Republican missteps, and a host of other factors could keep the band together for them. Maybe some of the more marginal voters that Obama brought to the polls to enact hope and change will return in 2010 to keep hope alive. But the personal nature of Obama's victory is starting to show its downside for downticket Democrats. The Clinton coalition is looking creaky. If Obama doesn't improve and the coalition comes apart, Democrats could find themselves weaker than they were even in the 1980s and 1990s. Sean Trende can be reached at strende@realclearpolitics.com.

"C05777243"	"B6 Let's do Tues evening. Do you know when I can see Maryann?"
"C05739766"	"Associated Press Published September 21, 2012 BENGHAZI, lli3YA — Hundreds of protesters angry over last week's killing of the U.S. ambassador to Libya stormed the compound of the Islamic extremist militia suspected in the attack, evicting militiamen and setting fire to their building Friday. In an unprecedented show of public anger at Libya's rampant militias, the crowd overwhelmed the compound of the Ansar Al-Sharlah Brigade in the center of the eastern city of Benghazi. Ansar Al-Shariah fighters initially fired in the air to disperse the crowd, but eventually abandoned the site with their weapons and vehicles after it was overrun by waves of protesters shouting \"No to militias.\" \"I don't want to see armed men wearing Afghani-style clothes stopping me in the street to give me orders, I only want to see people in uniform,\" said Omar Mohammed, a university student who took part in the takeover of the site, which protesters said was done in support of the army and police. No deaths were reported in the incident, which came after tens of thousands marched in Benghazi against armed militias. One vehicle was also burned at the compound. For many Libyans, the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was the last straw in one of the biggest problems Libya has faced since the ouster and death of longtime dictator Moamrnar Qaddafi around a year ago -- the multiple mini-armies that with their arsenals of machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades are stronger than the regular armed forces and police. The militias, a legacy of the rag-tag popular forces that fought Qaddafi's regime, tout themselves as protectors of Libya's revolution, providing security where police cannot. But many say they act like gangs, detaining and intimidating rivals and carrying out killings. Militias made up of Islamic radicals like Ansar Al-Shariah are notorious for attacks on Muslims who don't abide by their hardline ideology. Officials and witnesses say fighters from Ansar Al-Shariati led the attack on the U.S. consulate, which killed Amb. Chris Stevens and three other Americans. After taking over the Ansar compound, protesters then drove to attack the Benghazi headquarters of another Islamist militia, Rafallah Sahati. The militiamen opened fire on the protesters, who were largely unarmed. At least 20 were wounded, and there were unconfirmed witness reports of three protesters killed. Earlier in the day, some 30,000 people filled a broad boulevard as they marched along a lake in central Benghazi on Friday to the gates of the headquarters of Ansar Al-Shariah. \"No, no, to militias,\" the crowd chanted, filling a broad boulevard. They carried banners and signs demanding that militias disband and that the government build up police to take their place in keeping security. \"Benghazi is in a trap,\" signs read. \"Where is the army, where is the police?\" U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739766 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. Other signs mourned the killing of Stevens, reading, \"The ambassador was Libya's friend\" and \"Libya lost a friend.\" Military helicopters and fighter jets flew overhead, and police mingled in the crowd, buoyed by the support of the protesters. The march was the biggest seen in Benghazi, Libya's second largest city and home to 1 million people, since the fall of Qaddafi in August 2011. The public backlash comes in part in frustration with the interim government, which has been unable to rein in the armed factions. Many say that officials' attempts to co-opt fighters by paying them have only fueled the growth of militias without bringing them under state control or integrating them into the regular forces. Residents of another main eastern city, Darna, have also begun to stand up against Ansar Al-Shariah and other militias. The anti-militia fervor in Darna is notable because the city, in the mountains along the Mediterranean coast north of Benghazi, has long had a reputation as a stronghold for Islamic extremists. During the Qaddafi era, it was the hotbed of a deadly Islamist insurgency against his regime. A significant number of the Libyan jihadists who travelled to Afghanistan and Iraq during recent wars came from Darna. During the revolt against him last year, Qaddafi's regime warned that Darna would declare itself an Islamic Emirate and ally itself with Al Qaeda. But now, the residents are lashing out against Ansar Al-Shariah, the main Islamic extremist group in the city. \"The killing of the ambassador blew up the situation. It was disastrous,\" said Ayoub al-Shedwi, a young bearded Muslim preacher in Darna who says he has received multiple death threats because has spoken out against militias on a radio show he hosts. \"We felt that the revolution is going in vain.\" Leaders of tribes, which are the strongest social force in eastern Libya, have come forward to demand that the militias disband. Tribal leaders in Benghazi and Darna announced this week that members of their tribes who are militiamen will no longer have their protection in the face of anti-militia protests. That means the tribe will not avenge them if they are killed. Activists and residents have held a sit-in for the past eight days outside Darna's Sahaba Mosque, calling on tribes to put an end to the \"state of terrorism\" created by the militias. Militiamen have been blamed for a range of violence in Darna. On the same day Stevens killed in Benghazi, a number of elderly Catholic nuns and a priest who have lived in Darna for decades providing free medical services, were attacked, reportedly beaten or stabbed. There have been 32 killings over the past few months, including the city security chief and assassinations of former officers from Qaddafi's military. Darna's residents are conservative, but they largely don't fit the city's reputation as extremists. Women wear headscarves, but not the more conservative black garb and veil that covers the entire body and face. In the ancient city's narrow alleys, shops display sleeveless women dresses and the young men racing by in cars blare Western songs. And many are impatient with Ansar Al-Sharjah's talk of imposing its strict version of Islamic law. The group's name means \"Supporters of Shariah Law.\" \"We are not infidels for God sake, We have no bars, no discos, we are not practicing vice in the street,\" said Wassam ben Madin, a leading activist in the city who lost his right eye in clashes with security forces on the first day of the uprising against Qaddafi. \"This is not the time for talk about Sharjah.

NO FOIA WAIVER. \"If they are the 'supporters of Sharjah' then who are we?\" he said. \"We don't want the flag of Al Qaeda raised over heads,\" he added, referring to Ansar Al-Shariah's black banner. One elder resident at the Sahaba Mosque sit-in, Ramadan Yousset said, \"We will talk to them peacefully. We will tell them you are from us and you fought for us\" during the civil war against Qaddafi. But 'if you say no (to integrating into the) police and army, we will storm your place. It's over.\" Officials in the interim government and security forces say they are not strong enough to crack down on the militias. The armed factions have refused government calls for them to join the regular army and police. So the government has created a \"High Security Committee\" aimed at grouping the armed factions as a first step to integration, Authorities pay fighters a salary of as much as 1,000 dinars, around $900, to join -- compared to the average police monthly salary of around $200. However, the militias that join still do not abide by government authority, and critics say the lure of salaries has only prompted more militias to form. Officials and former rebel commanders estimate the number of rebels that actually fought in the 8-month civil war against Gadhafi at around 30,000. But those now listed on the High Security Committee payroll have reached several hundred thousand. \"All these militia and entities are fake ones but it is mushrooming,\" said Khaled Hadar, a Benghazi-based lawyer. 'The government is only making temporarily solutions, but you are creating a disaster.\" ### U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739766 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

But Bill Clinton's appearances on the midterm election trail are starting to turn voters' heads in a way that Barack Obama's simply are not. Democratic operatives say that Mr Clinton, who went through in 1994 the kind of setback that pollsters say Mr Obama will face in less than three weeks, is more effective at presenting the election as a choice between starkly different alternatives rather than a referendum on what people think of the Obama administration. So far the president, who has booked most of the next three weeks for campaigning, has been unable to pull that off. This week alone, Mr Clinton has shaken up two Senate races — in Kentucky and West Virginia — with appearances that have assisted Democratic candidates. Mr Clinton was due to speak in Las Vegas on Tuesday night to assist the embattled Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, and then move onto California later in the week. \"Bill Clinton is about as close to a secret weapon as the Democratic party has got,\" says Norm Ornstein, a political analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \"He has this ability to fire up the Democratic base that almost nobody else can do right now.\" Mr Clinton's intervention in Kentucky, where Jack Conway, the Democratic candidate, is locked in a tight race with Rand Paul, the Tea Party icon, is a good case in point. At the weekend Mr Clinton described Mr Paul, who wants drastically to shrink the size of the US federal government and has talked of abolishing the Federal Reserve, as a \"radical with no record to back it up\". Mr Paul, who has never run for elected office, hit back by reminding voters of Mr Clinton's former Monica Lewinsky scandal. \"I am not sure I would trust a man who had sex with an intern,\" said Mr Paul. \"I mean, do you think he's an honourable person?\" Mr Paul's trip down memory lane appears to have backfired. Few voters seem to care any longer about a scandal that occurred amid what in retrospect looks like a golden age of balanced budgets, job creation and the absence of foreign wars. \"Bill Clinton's strength is that he knows how to fight back and turn adversity into advantage,\" says Tad Devine, a veteran Democratic operative. \"He is also able to enter an individual race, take the temperature, understand what people are feeling and then base his appeal to voters on that.\" In the West Virginia Senate race, where Joe Manchin, the governor, is trailing John Raese, a wealthy local businessman, Mr Clinton on Monday came out punching. Referring to Mr Raese's plush Florida vacation home, the former president said: \"I'm here for a lot of reasons. One is that I don't think it's fair for West Virginia to have one senator and Florida to have three.\" Acknowledging voter anger in a state where Mr Obama has 29 per cent rating, among the lowest in the country, Mr Clinton added: 'I am old enough to know that if you make a decision when you are mad — and I am not just talking about politics here — there is about an 80 per cent chance you will make a mistake.\" In contrast, a lot of Democrats are critical of the way Mr Obama has framed the midterm campaign, shifting from one attack line to another without sticking to an overarching narrative. Last month, Mr Obama turned on John Boehner, the Republican congressional leader, in what looked like a move to depict him as the voters' alternative. More recently, Mr Obama has switched to attacking the Chamber of Commerce for allegedly funnelling foreign money into attack ads. But it has generated a lot of criticism. \"This election is awash with undisclosed money and it's fair to point out how disadvantaged the Democrats have been,\" says one consultant. \"But it isn't good politics at this late stage when voters clearly want to hear about the economy.\" Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2010.

As the only woman among the \"Big Six\" civil rights leaders, Dr. Height helped galvanize a movement that changed our country forever. She organized the \"Wednesdays in Mississippi\" meetings that brought black and white women together to find common ground and break down barriers. She never stopped fighting for what she knew was right. And through it all, she was always the best dressed woman in the room. We were blessed to know Dr. Height, to benefit from her grace, passion and wisdom, and to call her our friend. For decades, starting with the early days at the Children's Defense Fund, we worked with her, learned from her, and drew inspiration from her example. From the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to the Congressional Gold Medal, to the unveiling of a long-sought-after bust of Sojourner Truth in the United States Capitol, we had the privilege of helping honor Dr. Height and her accomplishments. Born before women had the right to vote, denied access to the college of her choice because of the color of her skin, and witness to nation divided, Dr. Height dedicated her life to the proposition that all Americans should have the opportunity to live up to their full God-given potential. Our nation is poorer for her loss but infinitely richer for the life she led, the progress she achieved, and the people she touched. Our thoughts and prayers are with Dr. Height's family today, and with her many loving friends and colleagues. She would be the first to tell us that the best way to honor her memory is to carry forward the work she started and the causes she championed, to open wide the freedom gates. May we all find the strength and the wisdom to live up to her legacy."

Zardari considers him his informal ambassador to the US. z..L ;; ;•=r-i e forc,; e Posted: i7 Dec 2010 03:08 PM PS' Incoming House Foreign Affairs chairwoman ileana Ros-Lehtinen. (R-FL) defeated a bill Thursday evening that would have committed the United States to combating forced child marriages abroad, by invoking concerns about the legislation's cost and that funds could be uses to finance abortions. The episode highlights the tough road that the °barna administration will face in advancing its women's rights and foreign aid agenda during the next Congressional session. Non-governmental organizations, women's rights advocates, and. lawmakers from both parties spent years developing and lobbying for the \"International Protecting Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act of 2010,\" which the House failed to pass in a vote Thursday. The bill failed even though 241 Congressmen voted, for it and only 166 voted against, because House Speaker Nancy Petosi (D-CA) brought it up under \"suspension of the rules.\" This procedure has the advantage of not allowing any amendments or changes to the bill, but carries the disadvantage of requiring two-thirds of the. votes for passage. ; Even still, supporters in both parties fully expected the bill to garner the 290 votes needed -- right up until the bill. failed. After all, it passed the Senate unanimously Dee. i with the co-sponsorship of several Republicans. including Appropriations Committee ranking Republican Thad Cochran (R-MS), Foreign Relations Committee member Roger ‘Vick-er (P.-MS), and human rights advocate Sam Brownback (R-KS). if passed, the bill would have authorized the president to provide assistance \"to prevent the incidence of child marriage in developing countries through the promotion of educational, health, economic, social, and legal empowerment of girls and women.\" It would have also mandated that the administration develop a multi-year strategy on the issue and that the State Department include the incidence of forced child marriage during its annual evaluation of countries' human rights practices. So what happened? Ros-Lehtinen first argued that the bill was simply unaffordable. In a Dec. i6\" she objected to the Post of the bill, which would be Si.08 million over five years, and criticized it for not providing an accounting of how much the U.S. was already spending on this (Alba The ' said the bill would authorize $1o8 million, but would only require $67 million in outlays from fiscal years 2011 to 2015. Ros-Lehtinen introduced her own version of the bill, which she said would only cost $1 million. But in a fact sheet gDF.), organizations supporting the original legislation said that Ros-Lehtinen's bill removed the implementation procedures that gave the legislation teeth. \"Without such activities, the bill becomes merely a strategy with no actual implementation. And without implementation of a strategy, the bill will have an extraordinarily limited impact,\" they wrote. Regardless, the supporters still thought the bill would pass because House Republican leadership had not come out against it. But about one hour before the vote, every Republican House office received a message on the bill from GOP leadership, known as a Whip Alert, saying that leadership Nyould vote \"no\" on the bill and encouraging all Republicans do the same. The last line on the alert particularly shocked the supporters. \"There are also concerns that funding will be directed to NGOs that promote and perform abortion and efforts to combat child marriage could be usurped as a way to overturn pro-life laws,\" the alert read. The bill doesn't contain any funding for abortion activities and federal funding for abortion activities is already ; prohibited by what's known as the almenè\" which has been boiler plate language in appropriations bills since 1973. Invoking the abortion issue sent the bill's supporters reeling. They believed that it was little more than a stunt, considering that Republican pro-life senators had carefully reviewed the legislation and concluded it would not have an impact on the abortion issue. Rep. Stephen LaTourrette (R-OH) - the Republican leadership for invoking the abortion issue to defeat the forced child marriage act in a floor speech .Friday morning. \"Yesterday I was on the floor and I was a co-sponsor with [on] a piece of legislation with [Rep. Betty McCollum (D-MN)] that would have moved money, no new money, would have moved money so that societies that are coercing young girls into marriage... we could make sure that they stay in school so they're not forced into marriage at the age of 12 and 13,\" LaTourette said. \"Ail of a sudden there was a fiscal argument. When that didn't work people had to add an abortion element to it. This is a partisan place. I'm a Republican. I'm glad we beat their butt in the election, but there comes a time when, enough is enough.\" But it was too late for LaTourette and other Republicans who had fought hard for the bill, including Aaron Schoch, (R-11). The bill is even less likely to pass next year, when the GOP will control the House and Ros-Lehtinen will control the Foreign Affairs committee. The main author of the bill was Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), who was incensed when the bill failed in the House. -The action on the House floor stopping the Child 'Marriage bill tonight will endanger the lives of millions of women. and girls around the world,\" Durbin said in a Thursday statement. \"These.voung girls, enslaved in marriage, will be brutalized and many will die when their young bodies are torn apart while giving birth. Those who voted to continue this barbaric practice brought shame to Capitol Hill.\" For the NGO and women's advocacy community, the implications of this defeat extend much further than just this bill. They also saw Republicans invoke the abortion issue when objecting to the International Violence Against Women Act and expect the new Congress to push for reinstatement of the \"Mexico City Policy,\" which would prevent federal funding for any organizations that even discuss abortion. \"Any time a health bill that has to do with women and girls comes to the House floor, we're going to see a debate like the one we just saw,\" said one advocacy leader who supported the bill. \"It's hard to imagine how any development bills are going to pass in this environment.\" The protection of women and girls is a major focus of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who promised to elevate the issue Thursday when rolling out the State Department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. She has said that forced child marriage is \"a clear and unacceptable violation of human rights\", and that \"the Department of State categorically denounces all cases of child marriage as child abuse\". State's Ambassador at Large for Global Women's Issues Melanne Verveer has worked hard on the issue behind the scenes. But at the eleventh hour, when the going got tough, the bill's supporters said that the administration was nowhere to be found. In October, the White House decided to waive all penalties under the Child Soldiers Prevention Act, another Durbin led bill that the NCO community supports. United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) estimates that 6o million girls in developing countries now between the ages of 20 and 24 were married before they reached 18. The Population Council, reproductive and child health, estimates that the number will increase by too million over the next decade if current trends continue. ! One of the two biggest problems identified in the Afghanistan-Pakistan Strategy Review released Thursday (?• :) is the Pakistani militasy's failure to crack down on some of the terrorist groups using Pakistan's tribal areas as a safe - haven from which to launch attacks across the border into Afghanistan. Pakistan • a major offensive, involving approximately go,000 troops, against extremists in South Waziristan in October 2009, and its military has also undertaken efforts to stamp out militants in other border areas. However, the military has yet to launch offensive military operations in North Waziristan, where insurgent groups wreaking havoc in Afghanistan reside. Pakistan's envoy in Washington, Ambassador Husain Haggai* reacted to the report by saying that Pakistan will engage isla.mist groups in North Waziristan, including the •Hartgani network (no relation), but only when there is sufficient support in all areas of Pakistan's government for the effort, and not until they are confident that the mission can be completed effectively. \"Pakistan has made it very clear that we are fighting terrorists because they are a threat to our own existence as a modern democratic nation. We will fight all groups in all parts of our country,\" Haqqani said in an exclusive interview with The Cable. \"But we will follow timelines that suit our own capabilities and can lead to success.\" Haqqani said that the Pakistani army, which has taken the fight to six out of the seven regions inside Pakistan in which domestic militant groups operate and suffered thousands of casualties in the process, is simply not in a position to expand its war on the extremists now. \"Right now, it's only a question of operational capability and readiness. Our armed forces have been engaged in dealing with flood relief work,\" he said. \"We have to see what resources we will allocate in which part of the country, and those rather than any political factors are responsible for any waiting period.\" He also noted that \"there is a fragile consensus in Pakistan in favor of military action against regional elements,\" and that Pakistan's government has no choice but to make the decision to attack North Waziristan groups on a timeline that prioritized Pakistani considerations over American ones. \"Sometimes it's easy for our allies to tell us what to do and for us to tell our allies what to do. But everyone makes decisions based on their own perceptions and analysis of on ground realities,\" Haqqani said. In several discussions with other Pakistani officials, an even more complicated picture of the Pakistani position on attacking groups in North Waziristan emerges. The Pakistanis largely believe that the U.S. government is being unrealistic in terms of the timelines it wants for cracking down on terrorist safe havens along the Afghanistan- Pakistan border, which have existed for decades. , \"There will always be a gap between our two countries because the Americans want things done quickly and done their way,\" another Pakistani government official said. ; A third senior Pakistani official said that many Pakistanis feel that the ()barna administration is placing too much of the blame on Pakistan for the lank of progress in the 'U.S.-led war in Afghanistan. 'The U.S. keeps telling Pakistan to do more, but Pakistan keeps telling the U.S. to do more on certain questions such as speeding up building up of Afghan army, establishing a real process toward reconciliation, and providing Pakistan the means for large scale operations,\" the official said. The United States has provided Pakistan with several billions of dollars in military and economic aid to support its war against domestic insurgents. But many in the Pakistani government have criticized what they say characterize as the slow arrival of these funds, which they say are in any case too small to address Pakistan's severe problems. \"It's very simplistic to measure success in amount of assistance provided to Pakistan,\" one Pakistani official said. In remarks delivered during the rollout of the strateu review Thursday, President Obama was diplomatic when discussing his administration's ongoing drive to push Pakistan to do more in North Waziristan. \"Increasingly, the Pakistani government recognizes that terrorist networks in its border regions are a threat to all our countries, especially Pakistan. We've welcomed major Pakistani offensives in the tribal regions. We will continue to help strengthen Pakistanis' capacity to root out terrorists,\" said Obama. \"Nevertheless, progress has not come fast enough. So we will continue to insist to Pakistani leaders that terrorist safe havens within their borders must be dealt with.\" Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy acknowledged in an interview the same day that there was more work to be done on the relationship before the Pakistanis were willing to fully support the U.S. and NATO-led mission in Afghanistan. \"Given the ups and downs of our historical relationship with Pakistan, they fear our abandonment,\" she said. \"Their calculus is very much affected by the long-term commitment they feel from us and in working in a strategic partnership.\" The White House recognizes that its efforts have fallen short so far. \"The bottom line is that Pakistan is a country where we have little influence, little access and little credibility,\" one of Obama's aides to■..-:), The New York Times. The administration's official line, therefore, is to agree with the Pakistani government and express sensitivity to its claim that they simply can't expand their war against extremists at this time. \"We would like them to move tomorrow, we would like them to take out these people tomorrow,\" the new U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter. \"But we understand they're telling us honestly about the capacity of their military, and when they are able, we are convinced they will move in.\" But for many in Washington, the open-ended delay in Pakistan.s promise to expand military operations into North. Waziristan represents a strategic choice, and is not just a result of the military's operational limitations. But whatever Pakistan's reasons, the delay doesn't inspire confidence that the Obama administration can meet its timelines for making progress in Afghanistan. \"Pakistan, meanwhile, iS hedging its bets, supporting proxy actors like the Quetta Shura Taliban and Haos iani Network that might counter Indian interests in Kabul after the United States and its allies eventually withdraw,\" Andrew Extnn of the Center for a New American Security. 'The insurgent sanctuaries in Pakistan are one of the two Achilles heels in the NATO strategy.\" ‘0 tt \" Posted: 17 Dec iOO C 4:42 AM PST In a rare instance of bipartisanship, the House of Representatives moved to pass a resolution Friday honoring the life and work of the recently departed Ambassador Richard Holbrooke. The resolution C, was sponsored by outgoing House Appropriations State and Foreign Ops Subcommittee chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-NY), and cosponsored by incoming House Foreign Affairs chairwoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Howard Berman (D-CA), and Mike Turner (R-OH). The bill is \"a concurrent resolution honoring the exceptional achievements of Ambassador Richard Holbrooke and recognizing the significant contributions he has made to United States national security, humanitarian causes and peaceful resolutions of international conflict.\" \"The passing of Ambassador Holbrooke on Monday, December 13th, is a great loss for the American people,\" Lowey said in a statement. \"One of our nation's most talented diplomats, Richard Holbrooke possessed a fierce determination and unsurpassed brilliance in advocating for American security, diplomatic, and development interests around the world - in Southeast Asia and post-Cold War Europe, at the United Nations, and most recently in Afghanistan and Pakistan. His exceptional accomplishments as a peace-maker, diplomat, writer, scholar, manager and mentor will define his legacy as one of the true great foreign policy giants of our time.\" Ros-Lehtinen praised Holbrooke as \"one of the most consequential world diplomats of the last half-century,\" and said that \"his tireless work in pursuit of United States national interests and international peace have put us all in his debt.\" After praising his career -- which included two stints as assistant secretary of state, peace negotiator in the Balkans, U.S. ambassador to the U.N., and service as U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan -- Ros- Lehtinen called for reform of the United Nations and protection of Israel within its bodies. \"In New York at the UN, [Holbrooke] did much of the heavy lifting on Congressionally-led efforts to rein in UN spending, to make more equitable the dues paid by the United States, and to improve the standing of Israel in that multinational body,\" she said. \"Sadly, those concerns have returned with a renewed urgency -- with the need for fundamental reform of UN budget and the virulently anti-Israel UN Human Rights Council -- and the Congress can only hope to have such a tenacious, principled partner in the future.\" You are subscribed to email updates from Email delivery Dowered by Google To stop receiving these emaIls, you may .r...hs■- . ; Inc. 20 West Kinzie, Chicago IL USA 60610"

We will meet with her this morning at 10 am to brief her for Tuesday's journey to Honduras. At this point, it appears we have a military aircraft available. The plan is for the U.S. Delegation to depart D.C., stop in Miami to pick up Ricardo Lagos, and arrive in Tegucigalpa together. We think this will send a powerful message to Hondurans and leave no doubt about our commitment to seeing this process through to a successful conclusion. You should be aware that Ambassador Hugo Llorens is under public assault. The Wall Street Journal dedicates its America's column this morning to attacking him and calling for his removal. Last Friday, Representative Connie Mack did the same. This chorus will grow as the extent of our accomplishment is understood. Llorens is a tough, stalwart guy. He and his Mission have held firm during this crisis. A call from you would be a big boost. Finally, we will hold an IPC today to identify further steps. We will keep you up to date on these steps and identify further opportunities for your engagement. I want to thank you for your leadership and support during this long crisis. Your willingness to engage at key moments and take risks at the right time have propelled us much further than anyone expected. Your diplomacy prevented a debilitating civil conflict in Honduras that would have destabilized Central America and undermined two decades of our efforts.

The Palestinians are ready provided there is a clear agenda. Israel says an agenda means preconditions. Resolving the snag over terms is crucial, diplomats say.\" Washpost The former NY Times reporter Judy Miller likes to address me as \"gloomy gus\" or some such thing when I encounter her. Well, stand by for some more gloom. The second Camp David talks failed because Dennis Ross and company placed the Palestinian delegation in a position in which a \"solution\" was demanded and expected by the Americans and Israelis on the basis of bargaining during the negotiations themselves. This seemed reasonable at the time to the US and Israeli negotiators. After all, is this not what one does? Should not the outcome be the product of the dialectic of argument and persuasion? Arabs generally think not. They tend to believe that negotiations are for the purpose of of arranging the details of outcomes that are understood in advance of the conference itself. For them, anything else is an attempt to win concessions through trickery. \"The Palestinians are ready provided there is a clear agenda. Israel says an agenda means preconditions.\" Hello! What kind of nonsense is this? Have we learned nothing? And then, there is the \"little\" matter of the non-participation of Hamas. Does the Obama Administration really think that this 600 pound gorilla can be ignored? Is this some sort of scheme on the part of Natanyahu, and \"the boys\" to discredit Abbas so that an isolated Hamas can be attacked and destroyed later? Realism in diplomacy is a desirable thing. George Mitchell used to be smarter than this. His staff should be advising him not to do this. Failure will be catastrophic. All the players should be engaged, and they are not. The outcome should be known in advance and it is not. This is both childish and destructive. pl http://www.washiLigtorsost. cortilwp-dyn/contentiarticie;2010/0811 9/AR201 0081 907203 htrni"

Please let me know what you think: Statement by the Secretary On the Restoration of Democratic and Constitutional Order In Honduras November 27, 2009 The United States remains committed to help restore the democratic and constitutional order in Honduras in the wake of the June 28 coup d'etat that removed President Zelaya and led to the suspension of Honduras from the Organization of American States. As part of that effort, it is essential for both parties in Honduras to implement the measures they agreed to in the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord, including the formation of a government of unity and national reconciliation and the December 2 congressional vote on President Zelaya\"s restitution. These are vital elements of the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord, and the Honduran people and the international community expect an expeditious determination. We look forward to the Congressional deliberations getting underway as announced. The November 29 national elections are another critical step in the restoration of the democratic and constitutional order in Honduras. The electoral process -- launched well before June 28 and involving legitimate candidates representing parties with longstanding democratic traditions from a broad ideological spectrum -- is conducted under the stewardship of the non-partisan Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which was also selected before the coup. The electoral renewal of presidential, congressional and mayoral mandates, enshrined in the Honduran constitution, is an inalienable expression of the sovereign will of the citizens of Honduras. We wish the Honduran people well as they choose their new leaders on Sunday, and we urge all sides to exercise their rights peacefully. The holding of a free, fair and transparent election is necessary but not sufficient for Honduras to reestablish the democratic and constitutional order. In order to help achieve that objective, we will continue, along with others in the region, to support the step-by-step implementation of the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord as a democratic way forward for the Honduran people. The president-elect who emerges from an election deemed free and fair will have a unique opportunity to promote that vital mission."

The return of menace to Jerusalem is not because a mid-level bureaucrat announced stage four of a seven-stage process in the eventual construction oft,600 apartments in Ramat Shiomo. a Jewish neighborhood in northeast Jerusalem. Such announcements and building projects have become so routine over the years that Paestinians have scarcely responded, let alone violently.

Why the sudden outrage over rebuilding a synagogue, destroyed by the Jordanians in 1948, in the Old City's Jewish Quarter, when dozens of synagogues and yeshivas have been built in the quarter without incident? The answer lies not in Jerusalem but in Washington. By placing the issue of building in Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem at the center of the peace process, President Obama has inadvertently challenged the Palestinians to do no less. Astonishingly. Obama is repeating the key tactical mistake of his failed efforts to restart Middle East peace talks over the last year. Though Oben-la's insistence on a settlement freeze to help restart negotiations was legitimate, he went a step too far by including building in East Jerusalem. Every Israeli government over the last four decades has built in the Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem; no government, let alone one headed by the Likud, could possibly agree to a freeze there. Obama made resumption of negotiations hostage to a demand that could not be met. The result was that Palestinian leaders were forced to adjust their demands accordingly. Obama is directly responsible for one of the most absurd turns in the history of Middle East negotiations. Though Palestinian leaders negotiated with Israeli governments that built extensively in the West Bank, they now refused to sit down with the first Israeli government to actually agree to a suspension of building. Obama's demand for a building freeze in Jerusalem led to a freeze in negotiations. Finally, after intensive efforts, the administration produced the pathetic achievement of \"proximity talks\"—setting Palestinian-Israeli negotiations back a generation, to the time when Palestinian leaders refused to sit at the same table with Israelis. That Obama could be guilty of such amateurishness was perhaps forgivable because he was, after ail, an amateur. But he has now taken his failed policy and intensified it. By demanding that Israel stop building in Ramat Shlomo and elsewhere in East Jerusalem—and placing that demand at the center of American-Israeli relations—he's ensured that the Palestinians won't show up even to proximity talks. This is no longer amateurishness; it is pique disguised as policy. Initially, when the announcement about building in Ramat Shlomo was made, Israelis shared Vice President Biden's humiliation and were outraged at their government's incompetence. The widespread sense here was that Netanyahu deserved the administration's condemnation, not because of what he did but because of what he didn't do: He failed to convey to all parts of his government the need for caution during Biden's visit, symptomatic of his chaotic style of governing generally. But not even the opposition accused Netanyahu of a deliberate provocation. These are not the days of Yitzhak Shamir, the former Israeli prime minister who used to greet a visit from Secretary of State James Baker with an announcement of the creation of another West Bank settlement. Netanyahu has placed the need for strategic cooperation with the U.S. on the Iranian threat ahead of the right-wing political agenda. That's why he included the Labor Party into his coalition, and why he accepted a two-state solution—an historic achievement that set the Likud, however reluctantly, within the mainstream consensus supporting Palestinian statehood. The last thing Netanyahu wanted was to embarrass Biden during his goodwill visit and trigger a clash with Obama over an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood. Nor is it likely that there was a deliberate provocation from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, which runs the interior ministry that oversees building procedures. Shas, which supports peace talks and territorial compromise, is not a nationalist party. Its interest is providing housing for its constituents, like the future residents of Ramat Shlomo; provoking international incidents is not its style. Finally, the very ordinariness of the building procedure—the fact that construction in Jewish East Jerusalem is considered by Israelis routine—is perhaps the best proof that there was no intentional ambush of Biden. Apparently no one in the interior ministry could imagine that a long-term plan over Ramat Shiomo would sabotage a state visit. In turning an incident into a crisis, Obama has convinced many Israelis that he was merely seeking, a pretext to pick a fight with Israel. Netanyahu was inadvertently shabby; Obama, deliberately so. Ac.t,cording to a banner headline in the newspaper Ma'ariv, senior Likud officials believe that Obama's goal is to topple the Netanyahu government, by encouraging those in the Labor Party who want to quit the coalition. The popular assumption is that Obama is seeking to prove his resolve as a leader by getting tough with Israel. Given his ineffectiveness against Iran and his tendency to violate his own self-imposed deadlines for sanctions, the Israeli public is not likely to be impressed. Indeed, Israelis' initial anger at Netanyahu has turned to anger against Obama. According to an Israel Radio poll on March 16, 62 percent of Israelis blame the Obama administration for the crisis, while 20 percent blame Netanyahu. (Another 17 percent blame Shas leader Eli Yishai.) • In the last year, the administration has not once publicly condemned the Palestinians for lack of good faith—even though the Palestinian Authority media has, for example, been waging a months-long campaign denying the Jews' historic roots in Jerusalem. Just after Biden left Ramailah, Palestinian officials held a ceremony naming a square in the city after a terrorist responsible for the massacre of 38 Israeli civilians. That too didn't merit an administration rebuke. Obama's one-sided public pressure against Israel could intensify the atmosphere of \"open season\" against Israel internationally. Indeed, the European Union has reaffirmed it is linking improved economic relations with Israel to the resumption of the peace process—as if it's Israel rather than the Palestinians that has refused to come to the table. If the administration's main tactical error in Middle East negotiating was emphasizing building in Jerusalem, its main strategic error was assuming that a two-state solution was within easy reach. Shortly after Obama took office, Rehm Emanuel vvas quoted in the Israeli press insisting that a Palestinian state would be created within Obama's first tent. instead, a year later, we are in the era of suspended proximity talks. Now the administration is demanding that Israel negotiate over final status issues in proximity talks as a way of convincing the Palestinians to agree to those talks--as if Israelis would agree to discuss the future of Jerusalem when Palestinian leaders refuse to even sit with them. To insist on the imminent possibility of a two-state solution requires amnesia. Biden's plea to Israelis to consider a withdrawal to an approximation of the 1967 borders in exchange for peace ignored the fact that Israel made that offer twice in the last decade: first, when Prime Minister Ehud Barak accepted the Clinton Proposals of December 2000, and then more recently when Prime Minister Ehud Olmert renewed the offer to Mahrnoud Abbas. Abbas, says Olmert, never replied. The reason for Palestinian rejection of a two-state solution is because a deal would require Palestinians to confine the return of the descendants of the 1948 refugees to Palestine rather than to Israel. That would prevent a two-state solution from devolving into a bi-national, one-state solution. Israel's insistence on survival remains the obstacle to peace. To achieve eventual peace, the international community needs to pressure Palestinian leaders to forgo their claim to Haifa and Jaffa and confine their people's right of return to a future Palestinian state--just as the Jews will need to forgo their claim to Hebron and Bethlehem and confine their people's right of return to the state of Israel. That is the only possible deal: conceding my right of return to Greater Israel in exchange for your right of return to Greater Palestine. A majority of Israelis—along with the political system—has accepted that principle. On the Palestinian side, the political system has rejected it. In the absence of Palestinian willingness to compromise on the right of return, negotiations should not focus on a two- state solution but on more limited goals. There have been positive signs of change on the Palestinian side in the last few years. The rise of Hamas has created panic within Fatah, and the result is, for the first time, genuine security cooperation with Israel. Also, the emergence of Salem Fayyad as Palestinian prime minister marks a shift from ideological to pragmatic leadership (though Fayyad still lacks a power base). Finally, the West Bank economy is growing, thanks in part to Israel's removal of dozens of roadblocks. The goal of negotiations at this point in the conflict should be to encourage those trends. But by focusing on building in Jerusalem, Obama has undermined that possibility too. To the fictitious notion of a peace process, Obama has now added the fiction of an intransigent Israel blocking the peace process. The administration, according to a report in the Israeli ne\Aispaper Yedito Aharonot, is making an even more insidious accusation against Israel. During his visit, wrote Yediot Aharanot, Bicien told Israeli leaders that their policies are endangering American lives in Afghanistan and Iraq. The report has been denied in the White House. Whether or not the remark was made, what is clear today in Jerusalem is that Obama's recklessness is endangering Israeli--and Palestinian-- lives. As I listen to police sirens outside my window, Obama's political Intifada against Netanyahu seems to be turning into a third intifada over Jerusalem.

Sid http://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/03/14/the_petraeus_briefing_biden_s_embarrassment_is_not_the_whole_sto ry The Petraeus briefing: Biden's embarrassment is not the whole story Posted By Mark Perry 4Saturday, March 13, 2010 - On Jan. 16, two days after a killer earthquake hit Haiti, a team of senior military officers from the U.S. Central Command (responsible for overseeing American security interests in the Middle East), arrived at the Pentagon to brief Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The team had been dispatched by CENTCOM commander Gen. David Petraeus to underline his growing worries at the lack of progress in resolving the issue. The 33- slide, 45-minute PowerPoint briefing stunned Mullen. The briefers reported that there was a growing perception among Arab leaders that the U.S. was incapable of standing up to Israel, that CENTCOM's mostly Arab constituency was losing faith in American promises, that Israeli intransigence on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was jeopardizing U.S. standing in the region, and that Mitchell himself was (as a senior Pentagon officer later bluntly described it) \"too old, too slow ... and too late.\" The January Mullen briefing was unprecedented. No previous CENTCOM commander had ever expressed himself on what is essentially a political issue; which is why the briefers were careful to tell Mullen that their conclusions followed from a December 2009 tour of the region where, on Petraeus's instructions, they spoke to senior Arab leaders. \"Everywhere they went, the message was pretty humbling,\" a Pentagon officer familiar with the briefing says. \"America was not only viewed as weak, but its military posture in the region was eroding.\" But Petraeus wasn't finished: two days after the Mullen briefing, Petraeus sent a paper to the White House requesting that the West Bank and Gaza (which, with Israel, is a part of the European Command -- or EUCOM), be made a part of his area of operations. Petraeus's reason was straightforward: with U.S. troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. military had to be perceived by Arab leaders as engaged in the region's most troublesome conflict. [UPDATE: A senior military officer denied Sunday that Petraeus sent a paper to the White House. \"CENTCOM did have a team brief the CJCS on concerns revolving around the Palestinian issue, and CENTCOM did propose a UCP change, but to CJCS, not to the WH,\" the officer said via email. \"GEN Petraeus was not certain what might have been conveyed to the WH (if anything) from that brief to CJCS.\" (UCP means \"unified combatant command,\" like CENTCOM; CJCS refers to Mullen; and WH is the White House.)] The Mullen briefing and Petraeus's request hit the White House like a bombshell. While Petraeus's request that CENTCOM be expanded to include the Palestinians was denied (\"it was dead on arrival,\" a Pentagon officer confirms), the Obama administration decided it would redouble its efforts -- pressing Israel once again on the settlements issue, sending Mitchell on a visit to a number of Arab capitals and dispatching Mullen for a carefully arranged meeting with the chief of the Israeli General Staff, Lt. General Gabi Ashkenazi. While the American press speculated that Mullen's trip focused on Iran, the JCS Chairman actually carried a blunt, and tough, message on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: that Israel had to see its conflict with the Palestinians \"in a larger, regional, context\" -- as having a direct impact on America's status in the region. Certainly, it was thought, Israel would get the message. Israel didn't. When Vice President Joe Biden was embarrassed by an Israeli announcement that the Netanyahu government was building 1,600 new homes in East Jerusalem, the administration reacted. But no one was more outraged than Biden who, according to the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth, engaged in a private, and angry, exchange with the Israeli Prime Minister. Not surprisingly, what Biden told Netanyahu reflected the importance the administration attached to Petraeus's Mullen briefing: \"This is starting to get dangerous for us,\" Biden reportedly told Netanyahu. \"What you're doing here undermines the security of our troops who are fighting in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. That endangers us and it endangers regional peace.\" Yedioth Ahronoth went on to report: \"The vice president told his Israeli hosts that since many people in the Muslim world perceived a connection between Israel's actions and US policy, any decision about construction that undermines Palestinian rights in East Jerusalem could have an impact on the personal safety of American troops fighting against Islamic terrorism.\" The message couldn't be plainer: Israel's intransigence could cost American lives. There are important and powerful lobbies in America: the NRA, the American Medical Association, the lawyers -- and the Israeli lobby. But no lobby is as important, or as powerful, as the U.S. military. While commentators and pundits might reflect that Joe Biden's trip to Israel has forever shifted America's relationship with its erstwhile ally in the region, the real break came in January, when David Petraeus sent a briefing team to the Pentagon with a stark warning: America's relationship with Israel is important, but not as important as the lives of America's soldiers. Maybe Israel gets the message now. Mark Perry's newest book is Talking To Terrorists http://warincontext.org/2olo/o3/14/israel-is-putting-american-liyes-at-risk/ My piece on the briefing of Admiral Mullen by CENTCOM senior officers has occasioned a great deal of comment, as well as some skepticism: how accurate is the account? Was it told to me by direct participants in the briefing? Is there any basis for imagining that Petraeus has any kind of hidden agenda, whether that is a desire to expand CENTCOM — or even hostility towards Israel. I won't name my sources, even though it's clear to people in the Pentagon — and certainly to General Petraeus — who they are. Was I told of the briefing by the briefers themselves? I will only say that there were four people in the briefing — the two briefers, Admiral Mullen, and Admiral Mullen's primary adviser on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I know two of the people involved in the briefing. Whether or not they are my sources is something for the reader to determine. The account is not only accurate, it's a precis of what actually happened. There is a lot more to it. The White House, State Department and Pentagon have not denied the account, and for good reason: it's true. Is there any basis for imagining that Petraeus has any kind of hidden agenda in ordering the briefing? I have been reporting on the American military for thirty years. My work on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Four Stars, is the authoritative account on the subject. I have deeply rooted contacts in the military that go back thirty years. I have never met a senior military officer whom I do not admire. There is no greater insult than to believe that General Petraeus or any other senior American military officer would use the lives of American soldiers as a lever to enhance their own political future. My sense is that General Petraeus neither likes nor dislikes Israel: but he loves his country and he wants to protect our soldiers. The current crisis in American relations with Israel is not a litmus test of General Petraeus's loyalty to Israel, but of his, and our, concern for those Americans in uniform in the Middle East. It is, perhaps, a sign of the depth of \"the Biden crisis\" that every controversy of this type seems to get translated into whether or not America and its leaders are committed to Israel's security. This isn't about Israel's security, it's about our security. http://maxblumenthal.com/2010/03/pastor-hagee-and- netanyahus-lovefest-on-eve-of-bidens-arrival-in-israel/ Netanyahu and Pastor Hagee's Lovefest on Eve of Biden's Arrival in Israel On 03.09.10, By Max (Videos recorded by Rachel Tabachnick; more videos coming shortly.) Vice President Joe Biden was greeted in Jerusalem with the announcement that the Israeli Interior Ministry approved the construction of 1600 new homes in Occupied East Jerusalem contrary to U.S. wishes and complicating Biden's mission to help jump start the peace process. But Biden should have known that Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu intended to upset his plans by Netanyahu's appearance with John Hagee. The day after a series of talks between US Special Envoy for the Middle East George Mitchell and Netanyahu, and a day before Biden's arrival, Netanyahu appeared onstage with Pastor John Hagee in Jerusalem. The occasion was Hagee's Night To Honor Israel, an event the far-right Texas-based preacher arranged to tout his ministry's millions in donations to Israeli organizations and to level bellicose rhetoric against Israel's perceived enemies. At the gathering, Hagee called Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad \"the Hitler of the Middle East\" and denounced the Goldstone Report as \"character assassination by an unbiased and uninformed committee.\" Netanyahu welcomed the crowd of 1000 American evangelicals to Jerusalem, a city he described as \"the undivided, eternal capitol of the Jewish people. Then, he told them, \"I salute you! The Jewish people salute you!\" He used the rest of his speech to call for \"tough, biting sanctions\" against Iran that \"bite deep into its energy sector.\" Hagee and Netanyahu appear together on stage: r-- X In the audience were top-level members of the Israeli government, from Ambassador Michael Oren to Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat to Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon. Also present was Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, the chief rabbi of the illegal West Bank settlement of Efrat who gained notoriety for lobbying President Bill Clinton to pardon his friend, fugitive billionaire Marc Rich. Ayalon had stirred controversy days before when he refused to meet with a US congressional delegation brought to Israel by the progressive Jewish group J Street. Part One of Hagee's speech: X Part Two. X Pastor Hagee in Jerusalem 3/8/10 (Part II) from Max J Blumenthal on Vimeo. Hagee's ceremony featured a 15-minute film highlighting the recipients of donations from John Hagee Ministries that totaled $58 million since 2001. The recipients included Jewish settlements from the West Bank like Gush Etzion and Shomron, which was involved in promoting an \"Obama Hilltop project\" that promoted more settlement building and compared Obama to Pharoah. Hagee also announced funding for a pressure group run by the settlers evacuated from Gush Katif in Gaza in 2005. During Israel's assault on Gaza in 2009, a group of Gush Katif residents lobbied the Israel government to allow them to resettle the Palestinian coastal region. Who is Hagee funding in Israel? X Who Is Haoee Funding In Israel? from Max Blumenthal on Vimeo. The most notable of Hagee's funding recipients was an organization called Im Tirtzu. A student representative of this group appeared in the film to thank Hagee for \"help[ing] us to ensure that students in Israel are on the right path, the path of Zionism, the love of Israel, the path of solidarity.\" Another student called for \"the second revolution in Israel.\" In February, Im Tirtzu funding a smear campaign against former Knesset member and New Israel Fund Director Naomi Chazan that included posters caricaturing her with a horn on her head. The group misleadingly accused the New Israel Fund of bankrolling 16 human rights organizations that contributed documentation to the Goldstone Report. The smear campaign led to unsuccessful legislation in the Knesset designed to further cripple already marginalized Israeli human rights groups. Meanwhile, the Jerusalem Post fired Chazan as a columnist without explanation. Gideon Levy, a columnist for Ha'aretz, called Im Tirtzu \"a McCarthyite movement\" for its attacks on Chazan. Although CUFI attempted to distance itself from Im Tirtzu's campaign, the organization's appearance during CUFI's Jerusalem ceremony suggested that Hagee would continue to provide it with funding well into the future. Republican Senator John McCain repudiated the endorsement of Hagee during his 2008 presidential campaign after Hagee's statements describing the Holocaust as a fulfillment of divine prophecy came to light. Hagee has also said that he believed the anti-Christ was \"partially Jewish, as was Adolph Hitler.\" However, none of Hagee's comments have deterred Israeli government officials from embracing him or accepting his millions in annual charity. During Hagee's speech, he made no secret of his support for the illegal settlement enterprise that has been the source of difficulties between the US and Israel. \"The settlements are not the problem,\" he boomed from the podium. \"The problem is the refusal of Arab leaders to respect the right of Jewish people to live anywhere in the Middle East.\" Hagee received a rousing ovation from the crowd and the Israeli government officials seated beside the podium when he proclaimed, \"World leaders do not have the authority to tell Israel and the Jewish people what they can and cannot do in the city of Jerusalem. They don't have the authority to tell them what they can and cannot build, who can and and cannot live there.\" The following day, on March 9, Vice President Joseph Biden arrived in Israel to meet with Netanyahu and officials from the Palestinian Authority. He told reporters after touching down that he saw \"a moment of real opportunity.\""
"C05772715"	"Declan, Thanks for your email. Of course it's not personal. But I do think it's wrong. When we were in Government we believed we could only succeed if we treated Northern Ireland as a bi-partisan issue and I encouraged other Governments to adopt the same approach. That meant when President Bush was in the White House, I went out of my way always to see and brief Democrats - in Congress and in the Senate - whenever I came to the States. It also meant when we held the first economic conference led by Mayor Bloomberg in Belfast, the dinner we gave at Hillsborough was not restricted to just those in respective Governments. In respect of how we handled the issue within the UK, that didn't mean I invited the Shadow Secretary of State to share every platform, but the Shadow was not excluded from being at major events. Indeed we made a point of not only saying we were bi-partisan, but acted accordingly. Having brokered the Hillsborough Agreement and having discussed with your Secretary of State - at all stages - how the US could help through an Economic Conference, I am obviously somewhat disappointed not to have been invited to attend the Conference in any capacity. That of course should never be confused with my deep respect and adMiration for Secretary Clinton. Frankly without her help during her time in the White House, as a Senator, as a candidate and now as Secretary, we could never have made the progress we did. You will know that, at the time, I was always disappointed that her contribution to the peace process and political process was not recognized appropriately by the Conservative Party and their spokesmen when they were in Opposition. The decision by Owen Patterson to decide not to be present at next week's Conference is a matter for him and the political demands he has chosen on which to determine his priorities.

The trip has been very productive and I will fill you in on some of the discussions I have been having when I return. In the meantime, I know that there are a number of discussions with Dan Benjamin and others relating to a new more aggressive approach to CVE and I wanted to update you on my thoughts in terms of how those critical discussions fit in with our overall approach to strategic communications around the globe. As you and I have discussed, it is essential that we become much more pro-active in all our communications efforts. To put it bluntly, we are in an \"information war\" on all fronts. With the proliferation of media outlets and opportunities around the world, we must fight aggressively to get, and maintain, our fair share of \"consumer share of mind.\" Both our adversaries and allies recognize the importance of this aspect of foreign policy and are adopting new ways of communicating with foreign publics. Consumers everywhere are constantly facing a barrage of information and in some cases misinformation and dis-information. In order to get our messages across and confront the threats posed by our adversaries, we must develop a new sense of urgency in all our communications efforts. Much has been said and written about the concept of \"soldier diplomats\". In the same vein, I believe we must empower a corps of \"diplomat soldiers\" to help us gain ground in this new war. While countering violent extremism is, and will remain, a key objective of our communications efforts we must apply the same level of determination with respect to all communications. We must both aggressively promote positive stories about the US and rapidly respond to attacks against us. In the past, our failure to respond to attacks and distortions has diminished our credibility and undermined our ability to combat our adversaries. For example, had we not responded to all the rumors and innuendos surrounding our relief efforts in Haiti, I believe we would have provided a fertile field for AQ and others to continue to perpetuate the image of the US as an \"invader\". Before I left for this trip, I convened a meeting of our top PD officers and told them that we must become much more aggressive in our strategic communications programs and initiatives. We plan to implement daily calls between our new regional PD DAS's and PAO's in the regions so we can monitor on a daily basis all stories about the USG. We will work with the Posts to ensure that they have strategies for dealing with stories as they develop. I would also like to request that you send a cable to all Chiefs of Mission informing of the new strategy and reminding them of their responsibilities in this critical area. We will work on a draft for your review when you return. Finally, we are developing new organizational solutions, modeled on an approach I saw at our Mission in Uganda, which I think will greatly clarify roles and responsibilities with respect to in country communications not only within the Mission, but across all government agencies within particular countries. I will continue to update you as we move forward. Hope your trip is going well. Look forward to greeting together when we are both back in DC. JM"

The language on the nuclear issue reflects where we were last summer -- still on the first track. Iran We are concerned about the aftermath of Iranian Presidential elections. We fully respect the sovereignty of Iran. At the same time, we deplore post-electoral violence, which led to the loss of lives of Iranian civilians. We express our solidarity with those who have suffered repression while peacefully demonstrating and urge Iran to respect fundamental human rights, including freedom of expression, as ensured by the international treaties it has ratified. The crisis should be settled soon through democratic dialogue and peaceful means on the basis of the rule of law. We call on the Iranian government to guarantee that the will of the Iranian people is reflected in the electoral process. We remain committed to finding a diplomatic solution to the issue of Iran's nuclear program and support renewed efforts to that effect, such as the readiness of the U.S. to enter into direct talks and the invitation from China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States to Iran to restart negotiations, as well as the constructive involvement of other G8 partners in the process. We stress the need for unity of action on the basis of agreed policy. We sincerely hope that Iran will seize this opportunity to give diplomacy a chance to find a negotiated solution to the nuclear issue. At the same time we remain deeply concerned over proliferation risks posed by Iran's nuclear programme. We recognise that Iran has the right to a civilian nuclear programme, but that comes with the responsibility to restore confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear activities. We strongly urge Iran to cooperate fully with the IAEA and to comply with the relevant UNSC Resolutions. Our meeting on the margin of the United Nations General Assembly opening week next September, will be an occasion for the G8 to take stock of the situation."

"C05775200"	"Diplomacy Before and After Conflict By Marc Grossman Conflict is a universal condition,' older than diplomacy. While conflict is a constant in human history, the nature of armed conflict, and especially the nature of 21st-century warfare, has been transformed. General Rupert Smith identified these changes in his book The Utility of Force: \"The ends for which we fight are changing; we fight amongst the people; our conflicts tend to be timeless; we fight so as not to lose the force; on each occasion new uses are found for old weapons; the sides are mostly non-state.\"2 The nature of 21st-century diplomacy is also changing. To be successful, diplomats must simultaneously shape, act upon, and react to global challenges. As Hans Binnendijk and Richard Kugler of the National Defense University argue, no single problem, danger, or threat holds the key to the world's future. What matters is their interaction and the simultaneity of our responses.3 The definition of victory, too, is different today. Twenty-first-century national security success will encompass a comprehensive definition of security, and will be achieved by the broadest simultaneous application of all elements of national power. This is the key to understanding Philip Bobbitt's concept of \"preclusive victory,\" which he describes as \"anticipatory, precautionary attention to possible futures,\" requiring an expansive and integrated approach to modern diplomacy, defense, and development. A diplomatic strategy designed to produce preclusive victory will include conflict prevention, successful negotiation, deterrence, the preparation for conflict should all else fail, and efforts to establish order, ensure stability, and promote political and economic pluralism after conflict. Diplomats have always been participants in both the prevention and management of conflict and its aftermath. The conflict prevention side of diplomacy occupied much of my time at the State Department from 1993 to 1997 as the Department's Executive Secretary and U.S. Ambassador to Turkey. Postconflict diplomacy was a defining issue of the last third of my career at State as Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs and as Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs from 2001 to 2005. I have tried to draw upon my experiences and observations to discuss here the scope and complexity of modern diplomacy, the methods and goals needed to prevent conflict, diplomacy's role when conflict is or seems to be unavoidable, and the contribution diplomacy can make to restoring stability following conflict. Diplomacy and Conflict Prevention Thanks to the efforts of scholars and practitioners, we can now make better use of the methods and theory of conflict prevention. The United States Institute of Peace and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars are two among many institutions that have taken a leadership role in these efforts. Michael Lund, a practitionerscholar, notes that the present uncoordinated and patchy nature of preventive diplomacy reflects the absence of any accepted international conflict prevention regime or system of governance—that is, of agreed upon arrangements through which geographic jurisdictions are allocated, functional responsibilities are assigned, norms and procedures are formulated, and actors are held accountable for their responsibilities.' He asks the crucial question to all those who seek to \"coordinate and rationalize\" a system of preventive diplomacy: where should responsibility for the tasks of preventive action be located—early warning, the decision to act, the formulation of a response, or the provision of bureaucratic and political support? Should it be horizontal, across different organizations or actors, or should it be vertical, up or down their chains of command?6 An example of conflict prevention that meets Lund's tests was the effort undertaken by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), in close collaboration with the European Union (EU) and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and supported by the United States, to avoid civil war in Macedonia in 2001. It is difficult now to recall that, until September 11, 2001, the possibility of civil war in Macedonia was a leading international headline. This successful campaign of conflict prevention was defined by the remarkable personal and institutional cooperation between the NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson and the EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (and a former NATO Secretary General) Javier Solana. I spoke often during this period to Lord Robertson, Solana, and Ambassador James Pardew, whom President George W. Bush and Secretary Colin Powell appointed as the U.S. representative to the effort and who, along with Francois Leotard, the EU Special Envoy, played a crucial role in negotiating and implementing the Ohrid Framework Agreement. As a direct participant, senior NATO official Mark Laity stated that there are insights about modern diplomacy and conflict prevention to be drawn from this effort, including the need for personal and institutional teamwork, the importance of early engagement in trying to head off violence, the need to choose the right people for tasks of this kind (including 21st-century diplomats who can act \"unconventionally\"), and the necessity of being able to apply appropriate force quickly.' Diplomacy When Conflict Is or Seems to Be Unavoidable When diplomacy fails to prevent conflict, the role of the diplomat changes. The new requirement may be to justify the use of force when all efforts to avoid conflict fail or to seek to address the underlying source of conflict when force is or seems to be inevitable and imperative. The February 1999 diplomatic negotiations in Rambouillet, France, were designed to show the world that NATO and the Contact Group were willing to make one last effort to avoid using military force to stop Slobodan Milosevic's attacks in Kosovo. I was in Rambouillet as Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs to support Secretary Madeleine Albright. After the first day or so of the meeting, there was so much chaos that I urged Secretary Albright to depart Rambouillet and leave the \"negotiating\" to those of us more junior. My strategy was that by not being present, the Secretary of State— and the administration—could keep a distance from an outcome that might be unacceptable to the United States. The Secretary had a different vision. Albright hoped Rambouillet would end the brutality against the Kosovars, but she was also prepared for the meeting to fail, and thereby all options for avoiding military conflict would be exhausted. Her idea was that we had to be seen to be doing everything we could diplomatically, including her continued presence, so that if Rambouillet was a failure, there could be no further excuses against taking military action. Secretary of State James Baker had pursued a similar strategy before the first Gulf War in 1991. Baker relates in his memoirs, The Politics of Diplomacy, that President George H.W. Bush had concluded the United States should offer a meeting in Washington for Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz followed by a Baker trip to Baghdad to show America's commitment to avoiding war if possible. Baker writes that he thought this proposal had three merits: it would give the administration one last diplomatic opening to avoid war; it would shore up domestic support for conflict; and it would show that, as the deadline for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait neared, the administration was doing something other than just preparing for war. The President's offer turned into the famous meeting between Baker and Aziz on January 9, 1991. As Baker recounts, \"I was under no illusions. I assumed the talks would be unsuccessful and that within a matter of days, we would be at war.\"8 In 2001-2003, the State Department leadership generally saw Iraq as a diversion from Afghanistan and not central to the war on terror. Saddam Hussein was a dictator and a menace— but \"in a box,\" posing no immediate, direct threat to the United States; focus should be kept on defeating al Qaeda in Afghanistan and supporting the new Afghan government.9 Iraq had been a source of tension and disagreement inside the State Department since the beginning of the administration, and there were some who sought to move the policy from support for \"smart\" United Nations (UN) sanctions toward an aggressive posture against Saddam. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote in Years of Upheaval about the second term of the Nixon administration that State Department culture emphasizes negotiability, which is a consciousness of what the other side will accept.' Kissinger did not consider this trait a particular positive at the time, and the department's culture of negotiability did not serve as a good guide to institutional behavior for most of the senior State officials who participated in the interagency debate leading to the invasion of Iraq. If that was so during the period surrounding 1970s détente with Russia, diplomatic efforts with the Shah of Iran, and the crisis in the Middle East and the resulting 1973 war, this culture of negotiability no longer served as a good guide to institutional behavior for most of the senior State officials who participated in the interagency debate leading to the invasion of Iraq. We took part in planning for the conflict and its aftermath assuming—or hoping—that events either at home or abroad would turn preparations for conflict into successful coercive diplomacy rather than the military action that was ordered in the spring of 2003. The State Department's Director of Policy Planning, Richard Haass, observed that while he was \"60:40 against going to war. . . no organization could function if people left every time they lost out on a 60:40 decision.\"' Haass was operating under the belief that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction; if he had known they did not, he says he would have been 90:10 against the war. And no senior Department of State officer resigned in protest. The department sought instead to try to recreate the successful Gulf War coalition of President George H.W. Bush and argued that the United States and its allies might compel Saddam to submit through a deployment of force in the region in early 2003. If this failed, there should be a sustained diplomatic effort to create a broad coalition to move militarily later in 2003. This possibility of a broad international coalition lost all relevance on January 20, 2003, when the French government announced that it would never support a second UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force in Iraq. Diplomacy in Preparation for Conflict Once conflict is inevitable or is initiated, one job of diplomats is to support military commanders in getting what they need to make conflict as short as possible, with the fewest casualties for Americans, allies, and civilians. This was the objective that the United States pursued in Turkey before the first Gulf War, which resulted in President Turgut Ozal's support of American efforts. The diplomatic effort to prepare for conflict in Kosovo also involved the whole of the U.S. Government and the governments of the NATO Allies. To pursue a successful bombing campaign, diplomats in many NATO countries arranged for overflight and support for Allied forces. A similar effort by U.S. diplomats took place before the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. American and allied diplomats worked closely with nations surrounding Afghanistan, including forging contacts with Central Asian states on security issues for the first time in order to achieve transit, overflight, and bed-down rights for American and coalition forces before the October 7, 2001, beginning of action in Afghanistan. Before the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, and especially after January 20, 2003, a similar effort began in earnest. Diplomats supported U.S. Central Command commander General Tommy Franks in order to make the war as short and successful as possible and to limit American, allied, and Iraqi civilian casualties. American diplomats worked with military commanders to seek access to facilities for U.S. forces and to participate in the public diplomacy effort to gain as much support as possible for the armed liberation of Iraq. American diplomats and Pentagon officials again paid particular attention to Turkey in an effort to convince the Turks to allow the 4th Infantry Division to transit that country to create a northern front in the battle against Saddam's forces. Although the State Department worried about the size of the Department of Defense (DOD) request to Ankara, it worked closely with both civilian and military authorities at the Pentagon to try to meet the need that had been identified by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Joint DOD—State diplomacy, however, could not overcome a negative vote in the Turkish parliament, which reflected strong public opposition to the war. The way the debate about using force is carried out inside the government influences attitudes and actions during and after conflict as well as future decisions on whether or not to use force. Military force may restore security, but it cannot resolve political or cultural sources of conflict. As Rupert Smith writes, \"We are engaging in conflict for objectives that do not lead to a resolution of the matter directly by force of arms, since at all but the most basic tactical level our objectives tend to concern the intentions of the people and their leaders rather than their territory or forces.\"' Smith argues that the civil-military structure designed to make political- military decisions is \"deeply problematic\" and distorts decisionmaking in many ways.13 In his book, Smith imagines a debate between British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and Ministry of Defense (MOD) officials about how to address the genocide taking place over a number of weeks in Rwanda during the summer of 1994. FCO: What can we do in the face of events in Rwanda? MOD: What do you want us to do? FCO: We ought to act. Something must be done. We can't have people being massacred. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council we cannot be seen to be doing nothing. MOD: So you want us to use military force? FCO: Yes. MOD: To do what? To stop the killing? FCO: Yes. Exactly. MOD: Who do you want us to fight? We are not clear who is doing the killing: is it tribe on tribe, or is it a force found _from a tribe? And Rwanda is a big country. Where do we start? Kigali, presumably, it's the capital and we would want an airhead. FCO: Well, there must be an international force, of course. MOD: And what would be the British aim in joining the force? FCO: To play our part as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. MOD: Is Britain to lead the force? FCO: No, it should be led by the UN—a proper UN mission. MOD: That will take some time to assemble, so it will probably be too late to stop the killing. FCO: Then the mission should be aimed at bringing postconflict order. MOD: OK But we need to be clear how many British troops are currently available. Given our deployments in Ireland, Bosnia and a few other places, not many. FCO: What do you suggest? MOD: What are our government's priorities? Is contributing to this force a higher priority than these other tasks we are already undertaking? FCO: Probably not. MOD: In that case, these UN forces always lack expeditionary logistic support. And if we want to speed up the deployment of this force, offering a logistic unit would probably be the most valuable contribution. FCO: Will that put our soldiers at risk? MOD: Hardly any.\" Many American diplomats will recognize this imaginary conversation, having participated in something like it dozens of times since the fall of the Berlin Wall. In the American debate, the issue also quickly focuses on who pays the bills. It is worth stating, at least in the American case, that officials at the Pentagon and DOD often were legitimately frustrated by the State Department's inclination to promote military missions for the Pentagon and the Armed Forces in an increasing number of situations that were important, but not vital, to U.S. national interests. While this readiness to volunteer U.S. military forces to solve problems around the world was a direct result of the lack of civilian capacity to do the jobs required, it leads to understandable consternation among those in uniform. Diplomacy and Restoring Stability Following Conflict There are many issues—defeating extremism, promoting pluralism, bringing the benefits of globalization to those who have not yet benefited, living sustainably on the planet, nonproliferation— that will be part of any definition of successful 21st-century diplomacy. But getting postconflict diplomacy right—creating the conditions for a preclusive victory—may be the most crucial of all. This is not an easy assignment. The concept of success can be redefined after the fact, further complicating the assessment. Successful democratic governance and economic development cannot be delivered on a certain date, and therefore the need for time and patience is a necessity on the ground. However, patience is limited in home countries, and \"fatigue\" often sets in. Thus, the potential for failure is high. Industrial war produced winners and losers; today's lines are not so clearly drawn, and the timeline may be longer. Rupert Smith again brings clarity to this assessment: We intervene in or even decide to escalate to, a conflict in order to establish a condition in which the political objective can be achieved by other means and in other ways. We seek to create a conceptual space for diplomacy, economic incentives, political pressure and other measures to create a desired political outcome of stability, and if possible democracy. . . . if a decisive strategic victory was the hallmark of interstate industrial war, establishing a condition may be deemed a hallmark of the new paradigm of war amongst the people.15 Smith's point can be pressed even further by recognizing the additional distinction between a military operation carried out following Smith's rules and the ambiguity inherent in trying to create the conditions Smith identifies as objectives. Christopher Schnaubelt has noted that a typical military operation will have unambiguous geographic boundaries (areas of responsibility) and will assign specific units to be responsible for every inch of ground or cubic foot of airspace. There is an obvious chain of responsibilities and expected actions between each individual Soldier or Marine on the ground and the commanding general. Nothing comparable exists for economic development in governance tasks, which tend to be assigned by function rather than local geography or rigid hierarchy of authority.16 Postconflict diplomacy was among the defining diplomatic issues of the last third of my career at the State Department. In the aftermath of the first Gulf War in 1991, almost 500,000 Kurds fled to the mountains between Iraq and Turkey. Stranded in harsh conditions, they began to starve by the thousands each day. I was then the Deputy Chief of Mission in Turkey. Inspired by the leadership of Ambassador Morton Abramowitz, American diplomats, followed by American military forces and then an international coalition of governments and nongovernmental organizations, initiated Operation Provide Comfort (which became Operation Northern Watch). This was not just a \"whole-of-government\" but a \"whole-of-theinternational- community\" campaign to provide humanitarian assistance and then return the Kurds to their homes in Northern Iraq. Once home, they needed to be protected, and for 11 years, the United Sates and some of its allies, including Turkey, worked on the ground there to recreate a functioning society and then protected this area from Saddam by enforcing a no-fly zone. These years were also punctuated by activity in the Balkans. As Richard Holbrooke recounts, some of the pre-Dayton negotiations with Bosnian leader Alija Izetbegovi took place in my residence while I was Ambassador to Turkey:7 As one of Holbrooke's successors as Assistant Secretary for European Affairs, I watched the effort made by Ambassadors Robert Gelbard and James Dobbins to implement the Dayton Accords by applying whole-of-government efforts in postconflict post- Yugoslavia. I picked up the diplomatic thread again as Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs promoting reconciliation, development, political progress, and nationbuilding in Kosovo. Other postconflict diplomacy efforts in Haiti, East Timor, and Liberia called upon the resources of the United States and other governments to try to create the conceptual space for development and sustained peace. The U.S. effort in Colombia, too, highlighted the need to focus on an integrated and cross-sectoral approach, which included disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of former combatants and promoted justice in postconflict society. But the main events in modern diplomacy's postconflict paradigm are Afghanistan and Iraq. The key to understanding U.S. diplomacy in postconflict Afghanistan and Iraq is to recall the profound disagreement inside the U.S. Government, especially between DOD and State, about whether the United States should engage in \"nationbuilding,\" a policy President Bush had campaigned against in 2000. State Department professionals were generally proud of the effort the United States had made in nationbuilding and in peacekeeping, supporting the deployment of U.S. military forces to participate, for example, in the Multinational Force and Observers in the Sinai and in peacekeeping and nationbuilding activities in East Timor, Haiti, and the Balkans. Most believed that nationbuilding, properly funded and executed, was an effective long-term tool of integrated modern diplomacy for the United States. The effort to create a new Afghan government after the overthrow of the Taliban was a piece of classical diplomacy carried out in the 21st-century context.'8 Secretary Powell directed Ambassador Dobbins to support the regional negotiation hosted by the Germans in Bonn in 2001 to create a new Afghan government. To succeed, Dobbins worked with all the key players, including representatives from Iran, to support a major role for the United Nations and put Hamid Karzai in position to lead a new Afghanistan.' But, as Dobbins has written, the \"Bush Administration, having overthrown the Taliban and installed a new government in Kabul, determined that American troops would do no peacekeeping and that peacekeepers from other countries would not be allowed to venture beyond the Kabul city limits. Public security throughout the rest of the country would be left entirely to Afghans, despite the fact that Afghanistan had no army and no police force.\"2° The struggle over nationbuilding also hampered American attempts to get sufficient amounts of U.S. or international assistance to Afghanistan. Washington accepted the diffusion of responsibility there, with the British taking charge of counternarcotics, the Italians reforming the justice sector, and the Germans training police. This satisfied the need for burden-sharing but did not lead to success. In addition, postconflict resources focused by the United States on Afghanistan were small compared to other recent postconflict situations, even including Kosovo.' American diplomats who followed Dobbins to the Embassy in Kabul over the years faced the legacy of this lack of attention and underinvestment.22 The State Department participated at many levels in the National Security Council—led planning for postconflict Iraq. Much of the planning was detailed, but focused on lessons learned from the first Gulf War. The department's Future of Iraq Project, while important, would not have solved Iraq's postwar problems. State did not have the capacity to take responsibility for the immediate postconflict administration of Iraq, and its leadership agreed to the Executive order creating a postconflict Iraq structure that reported to the Secretary of Defense. There is no need here to recount the lost lives and lost opportunities so well chronicled by others in the immediate postconflict period in Iraq, although Dobbins's argument that, looking back, the Coalition Provisional Authority accomplished a great deal under trying circumstances is worth noting.23 On July 1, 2004, the State Department did officially open (on time and on budget) an Embassy in Baghdad, which allowed an expansion of diplomacy and led to more comprehensive senior civilian-military cooperation. There is another important lesson to draw from recent postconflict efforts: the need to have adequate civilian capacity to respond, including a role for a revitalized U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). As this journal chronicled in an article' by Ambassador John Herbst, the Secretary of State's Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS), his office was mandated to develop a whole-ofgovernment civilian response to stability operations and to ensure civilian-military coordination. The Civilian Response Corps (CRC) is in an early stage, and ultimately will be made up of a reserve component, in addition to the existing active and standby components. The personnel are anticipated to represent the full range of sector experts: engineers, lawyers, judges, corrections officials, diplomats, development experts, public administrators, public health officials, city planners, border control officials, economists, and others. Currently, the active and standby components that are being stepped up are drawn from State, USAID, and a core group of domestic U.S. Agencies. Once congressionally funded, the reserves would be drawn from state and local governments and the private sector. Between January 2008 and May 2009, 56 CRC members deployed to 11 countries, including Afghanistan for planning purposes, and there are realistic plans to have 250 active members and 1,000 standby members ready to deploy by the end of 2010. There are now at least 14 other countries with whom the United States allies that have a civilian peacebuilding capacity—some including stability or civilian police, and employing wholeof- government or \"comprehensive\" approaches similar to that created by Washington. Several, in fact, have higher budgets proportionate to their gross national products than America's.25 One way for State to further support the S/CRS effort would be to consider creating a new personnel specialty: the \"expeditionary diplomat.\" Washington's diplomatic personnel have, of course, always been in one sense expeditionary; the majority of the Foreign Service is deployed abroad the majority of the time. But the post-9/11 diplomatic experience, and especially the effort in Iraq and Afghanistan, means that State needs to be more explicit about the expeditionary nature of some of its future diplomatic work and should prepare a small but significant number of people to serve successfully in the hardest places at a moment's notice. Experience with the Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Iraq and Afghanistan, the lessons learned with S/CRS, and the example of diplomats who have pursued careers in the toughest posts should lead State leadership to conclude that this is a step worth taking. The first requirement would be advanced training, some of it provided by DOD and some by the Central Intelligence Agency, for those entering diplomats who believe they want to pursue this special career path. These entering officers would make an explicit choice and understand that an investment in their extra training would require their service in hard places, just as we now ask diplomats who take the hardest languages— Chinese or Arabic, for example—to serve more than one tour using their skills. Since these expeditionary diplomats will not need to meet the same age and physical requirements as special operations in the military, the State Department could allow people to opt in and out of this \"special force\" during their careers as long as they have the proper training. This would allow flexibility across the institution and encourage those who desire or whose family circumstances might change over time to participate as well. The department would also need to make sure those taking this career path are recognized for a career beyond the norm for Foreign Service and are promoted and rewarded. The creation of S/CRS is a symbol of the comprehensive, simultaneous diplomacy needed for the future, and this expeditionary diplomat could form the backbone of the State and USAID commitment to the civilian response capacity. There are still key questions to be answered about civilian capacity. In the face of a real world situation, will DOD really support a State Department—led operation? Will Congress adequately fund S/CRS, including a reasonable contingency fund? How will S/CRS and a resurgent USAID work together? Where will the lines be drawn between immediate postconflict needs and nationbuilding? There seems to be no question that the path is the right one, consistent with the administration's focus on diplomacy, development, and defense. Success will come with clear direction and active implementation. If we combine the observations made by several authors,' we arrive at this question: What national policies, supported by adequate human and financial resources, will create the conditions during and after war to bring about a preclusive victory? Nation building, post- conflict reconstruction and stability operations, and counterinsurgency strategy (call it what we will) will be part of modern diplomacy for years to come. Accomplishing this task does not have to be an exclusively American responsibility, and, indeed, one of the goals of modern American diplomats will be to make these efforts more international. But for the foreseeable future, the United States will need to learn the lessons of its role in nation building from Germany to Iraq.\" These lessons include support for new institutions that bring all of the elements of power and influence together in the same theater, at the same time, and in close coordination so the United States and its allies and friends have a chance to succeed.28 As Philip Bobbitt has written, \"The problem is the picture of warfare to which we cling. This picture unfolds in this way: peace making by diplomats; war making by the Armed Forces; peace building by [US]AID and reconstruction personnel. The reality of 21st century warfare, however, is that all of these tasks must be performed simultaneously.\"' While the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century can be observed and analyzed individually, none of them can be solved without reference to the others. Diplomacy is not the answer to every question, but it has utility both before and after conflict. As General Smith writes at the end of his volume: For the general purpose of all interventions is clear: we seek to establish in the minds of the people and their leaders that the ever present option of conflict is not the preferable course of action when in confrontation over some matter or another. This applies as much to the state possessing nuclear weapons or seeking to obtain them, rogue or otherwise, as it does to the * terrorist or the machete-wielding rebel; each is posing an armed threat to people to establish a condition in which to achieve its political goal. To do this, military force is a valid option, a lever of intervention and influence, as much as economic, political and diplomatic levers, but to be effective it must be applied as apart of a greater scheme focusing all measures on the one goal.3° The connection to the utility of a modern diplomacy is clear. Twenty-first-century diplomacy, working to prevent conflict, trying to get ready for it if it is inevitable, or dealing with the consequences, can be an effective tool of national security if it is adequately funded, carried out by well-trained, dedicated people, focused on clear goals set by national leaders, and backed by effective military force. This is the diplomacy of the future. The author expresses appreciation to The Cohen Group for allowing him time to consider these issues and to the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the Harvard John F. Kennedy School Project on Diplomacy for supporting the effort. The author also gratefully acknowledges the important contributions of Toni Getze, Jill O'Donnell, and Daniel Bliss in making this article a reality.

"C05770163"	"Madam Secretary, Following up on your trip to Ecuador, Jake asked me to send you a quick update on the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) listing of Ecuador: (SBU) On June 25 the FATF moved Ecuador down a notch from a list of countries with serious strategic deficiencies in measures against money laundering and financing terrorism. Ecuador is now on the \"Improving AML/CFT Compliance: On-going Process\" list for showing progress in its efforts against money laundering and financing terrorism. (SBU) According to Treasury, the change in Ecuador's status stems from its commitment to an action plan with the FATF, and the GOE's demonstrated high-level political commitment to work toward AML/CFT (anti-money laundering — combating the financing of terrorism) compliance. WHA is looking into options for next steps. Please let me know if you would like any further information. Best, Mike Michael H. Fuchs U.S. Department of State (202) 647-1709 (cell)"

"C05771368"	"En route back from India and China. It was good I went to Chennai where I had a full schedule including meeting with another self-help group like SEWA (500 poor women showed up) It took me back to our trips. Also met with the local elected village council -- remarkable group of empowered women. I took both experiences to our strategic dialogue meeting in Delhi where we made excellent progress. We also met with the \"cookstove\" officials to give them heads up about your initiative (told Roemer too). SEWA will be on stage with you at CGI! Other good meetings with SEWA on markets, Afghanistan, and solar lanterns. Vital Voices conf was a huge succss. I couldn't stay for much but your video was well received, Hormats was terrific (he's becoming a rock star with women!) And F Secretary Rao did a nice job. Our China experience provided a lot of insights and we will do a short strategy paper for you. We moved the women's leadership forum forward. Suifficeth to say, there are so many opportunities that I believe we should be taking advantage of, (which we are not doing) including in the economics track. The women there are growing in power and influence. More later. I'll see you for the NY marathon!"
